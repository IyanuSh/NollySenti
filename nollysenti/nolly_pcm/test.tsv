Lionheart.... Nah di best movie for me. Di comedy dey on point. Nkem Owoh kill am and Genevieve too do well.	positive

I think say dis nah excellent film and di actresses do excellent job.	positive
"Dos negative review for dis movie nah joke. People suppose leave dia personal feeling and viewpoint out of am when dem dey review a movie. And those wey dey petty enough to call di director as a 'liar,' dem dey claim say ""dis never happen"" nonsense dey equally ridiculous ; nah movie im be, dem create am to  entertain  and educate. Wetin concern me if nah fact or fiction? Di people wey dey get dis complaint fit dey believe dat Hollywood trash like ""pearl Harbor"" nah fiction dem dey alway be. On top di technical aspect of dis movie, ( something wey really matter), "" farming"" nah beautiful, artful shot slice of eye candy, wey dey ironic condidering di grotesquely ugly themes fo di difficult movie. Kate Beckinsale dey believable as di cockney speaking londoner wey bring extral cash into di house di Nigerian pikin dem wey di parent wey no get means to raise dem leave for her care. Growing up in a place wey oyinbo people plenty, where everyone get at least little racist, and sometimes intensely racist against di people wey get skin colour as young Enitan, di Nigeria boywey dey inside the alien world where everybody dey diffirent from him. Dis film dey about self identity, and how di kin surroundings and upbringing dey shape di ki person wey we become, and how our mind take dey work. Although Enitan dey Black, he grow like every of im mate, wey dey despise people wey get black skin. What insane and theme wey dey unique for a film... FINALLY something wey dey different. When Enitan join body with skinhead gang wey bin dey always tortur him, things begin dey intense indeed. He call himself Andy and shave off him offending afro, him dey really despirate to be among di people e dey relate too even though dem no like am and dey always abuse him. Movies wey dey about skinhead culture dey rare, maybe one dey appear every 10 years. Dis one standout from di one wey don dey, di one wey include ""This England"", ""Romper Stomper"" and e dey similar in tone with ""Made in Britain"" with Tim Roth. Another one wey dey worthy of praise nah di actin of ni "" farming"" as everyone give better action, John Dagleish give us ferocious performance as ""Levi"" di leaderoh dem Tilbury skinhead and di wey Damson Idris take potray di tortured, Enitan wey no like himself dey brave and e no get any fault. Dis movie dey destiny for cult statue as e find di right people wey go watch am. Di pathetic  1 star reviews show say di movie no reach di right audience. Oh well, ""Blade runner"" too nah flop when e first come out, so nah time go tell. I recommend ""farming""  to people wey like edgy cinema an d wey no dey shy away from scenario wey no dey comfortable, and for people wey get interest for skinhead youth culture of di 70's anda 80's. E  dey similar to ""The Krays"" and ""Legend"" thank God say dis also nah British produce am, e manage to avoid di sappy, moralizing and PC garbage wey Hoolywood think say dey need to put for e production."	positive
Dem talk am with raw emotion and clear fight fight, e change di element of im tori into coming of age drama wey dey disturbing, and eye -opening.  	positive

Farming dey base on di life of  writer /director Adewake Akinnuoye-Agbaje as a young Nigerian boy wey one white working class British family takecare of am for 1980's. Dis nah someting wey dey occur since 1960's-1980's and dem con know am as farming. Di film main focus dey on Identity and how dis young boy grow up confuse and dey alone with verbally abusive and casually racist white British mother and traditional conservative Nigerian parents wey he see for every few years. He struggle to accept who e be, e dey form strong desire to be white but last last e fall for in with group of abusive and violent skinhead, e don dey lose im way until something traic and violent event led am back to di right path and e con accept e own identity. I think say dis dey excellent. Damon Idris dey superb in di lead role as someone wey dey filled with so much hate for himself and odas wey share im cultural identity yet e also hate di group wey don form around him. E dey tense, harrowing and nah powerful film and my heart break for any children wey dem put through dis system bcos nah reall struggle e go be to dey adjust to life in Nigeria after dem don spend time growing up on di streets with the white British working class.         	positive

Be like say dem write di timing of di film for stars. Nan original twist on top themes of di farmily/ racism/fascism. Profound moment of child wey dey crave for family and intimacy, alongside upbringing wey dey abusive. E go punch for stomach. Kudos  to di writer/director wey work tirelessly to make sure say di project dey screen and di major U.K film funder stay away from am. E take di project to di to Creative England's iFeatures but e no make di cut... in a way, e work to di writer/directors hand to have a told a bold British tori base on a true tori with Hanway films. Make una Watch & Support playing now!     	positive
E simply dey relate di narrative of Andrew Dosunmu's seductive immigrant drama Mother of George fit do little make e fit convey di film's stark, poetic power, much less its extraordinary visual and sonic acumen.	positive

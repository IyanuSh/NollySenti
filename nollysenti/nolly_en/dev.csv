"AMAZING!. . . . Stella acting, stella production, stella directing.. . . . The movie was an experience. I was on the edge of my sit for 7 hours binge watching the whole series.",positive
It is globally minded filmmaking that is also comfortingly familiar.,positive
"A great children movie. . . . I think the Mirror Boy is a great children movie, simple in spirit, yet powerful, effective and well performed. The soundtrack is awesome, varied and rich, quite appealing and also bridging tradition and contemporary concepts",positive
"Seeing Richard Mofe-Damijo (RMD) as Ejiro, a retired thug for hire and crime lord, is a complete departure from his usual role of the wealthy father, he kills it.",positive
"On the 1st of August, a graduation party brings more than anyone expected.. . . . The film is a suburban drama that examines how a family manages to survive its past, and how that past is inextricably entwined with their future. . . . . During a graduation party, the estranged father, Dipo, returns. Each family member deals with his return differently, and thus we see how they must have survived his initial departure. As we learn the reasons for his departure and the reasons for his return, our sympathies shift.. . . . The film is well acted and the story unfolds itself smoothly and naturally, without resorting to exposition. It is refreshing to see a dramatic film about African Americans that veers from stereotypes.",positive
"Adorable.... . . . A very good plot, a mix of suspense and superstition, predictable until the end, with a good plot twist, good performances, in love with the works of Kunle Afolayan, who always acts in his films, in which he directs, writes and produces, multifunctional ... Adorable...",positive
Doctor Lanre' is an Interesting Shift. . . . I am glad to be one of the first on the train of this movie. This is an interesting shift. The story has a rich plot that is carried effortlessly by the superb performances of the cast. . . This is a must-see.,positive
"As Adenike, Gurira is wonderful: Her face is equally radiant whether she's channeling anguish or joy, and she captures the ways in which this woman, so old-country dutiful, also longs to join the modern world.",positive
Best of the best,positive
"Good movie.... . . . Excellent film, in a dystopian future in Nigeria, with all its ailments, a hope in honesty and manliness, turn to chaos, very good, female characters in addition to beautiful strong and determined, unscrupulous taking advantage of despair and helplessness, good tension scenes , good movie..",positive
Nice award movie. . . . Nice award movie and the actress are amazing lovely and very outstanding movi,positive
Great Tale. . . . This is a premium movie anytime. Tells the tales of our society decay. So sad! So true!,positive
Made me interested in learning more about Nigerian history. Any movie that makes me want to learn more gets at least 4 stars in my book.,positive
"Breathtakingly nice movie!. . . . At first I was a bit skeptical, as I wasn't exposed to Nigerian cinema before. However, by the end of the movie (brilliantly done by the way), I realised that I witnessed an audio-visual masterpiece. Highly recommend!",positive
A feel-good movie with the right cultural mix. A lot to be learnt from a super woman who fights hard to keep her place in a male dominated world. Warm and awesome movie!,positive
"It was Fantastic!! Ignore the negative reviews. . . . Honestly. It was mindblowing! Didn't even believe it was shot in Nigeria, the production was special and the cast were A1. They all played thier parts well and made it fun!",positive
An intimate study of challenges of motherhood,positive
"Something new. . . . Despite seeing its low rating - I think, Namaste Wahala definitely deserves a 1 time watch for being something new and different.",positive
"Nice movie!!!!. . . . I love the story line, I love the act and I love the fact that its a story about what is really happening in our society",positive
"Farming makes for a harrowing watch, but Idris is a star in the making, and Beckinsale is terrific as a Tilbury mommie dearest.",positive
fun movie,positive
Give the movie some credit. . I think it was very interesting and had some brutal violence but I find it necessary to tell the story.,positive
Very funny movie. . . . This movie is very funny.I literally laughed from the begining to the end.,positive
A Good One. . Hmmm... This was a movie. A GOOD ONE and that's about it.,positive
"Running for only a paltry sixty six minutes, 'The Delivery Boy' is the quintessential definition of ""Quality over Quantity"". This movie is one of the best movies we have seen come out of ""Young"" Nollywood. The makers had the good sense to match technical quality with a good story that is simple, yet very engaging and avoids being overly predictable like its lazy counterparts ""Young"" Nollywood is wont to churn out.. . . . We had fun seeing this today, and so did the miniscule audience we were blessed to see it with. We all left the hall with zero regrets. And we are sure you will too. While 'The Delivery Boy' is far from being perfec, we can confidently tell you that; if there ever was a Nollywood movie that deserved your support by paying to see it, 'The Delivery Boy' is the one. It is incredibly bold and progressive. Applaudable material. Go for it!",positive
Movie is everything!,positive
"Broke the mould. . . . I've watched a lot of Nigerian films. The quality can vary in terms of storyline, cinematography, actual acting, sound quality. This film broke the mould in all those respects.",positive
A coming of age dramedy that loses its way in the mean streets of modern Africa.,positive
"Nigerian Prince pulls you in, charms you, and tells you a complex and powerful story without losing itself. The film draws no clear moral conclusions, no clear solution as to what, or who, is right or wrong.",positive
Slowly blossoming into something beautiful. This film is about two childhood friends who fight against the odds to be together.,positive
A Noble Directorial Debut. . . . I discovered this on Tubi and I enjoyed it. It has its flaws but it doesn't take away from how great the film is. . . . It's a great movie,positive
Art Immitating Life...or is it?,positive
"Overall, it was entertaining but like most Nollywood films, there were no added layers of complexity; the good and bad guys are always too easily identifiable and thusly one dimensional.",positive
"This movie really need more credits as it's brilliant documentary-style filmmaking. Never saw any pandemic movie like this, a fresh perspective.",positive
"I love this movie, but I can't understand who died and who didn't. It is a horror movie, but I am a 7 year old and I'm okay. I would rate it 6+.",positive
"It's a feel-good movie, and a true story apparently.",positive
"decent. Acting and story were good, but production/execution could have been a bit better. overall ok.",positive
A powerful movie that will move your heart.,positive
Pretty uneventfull. Good movie - British politics....ha.,positive
some scenes in this movie are really touching. watch it,positive
Superb Sound Effects. . . . The movie is really good. The actors were brilliant. The ending was questionable but the sound effects were the best I've heard in any Nigerian movie till date.,positive
Nice movie but for 18+. . . . Nice movie for 18+ . I enjoyed every bit of the movie.,positive
Interesting and enlightening movie‚Å∑. . . . The movie seems to pass messages connected to different aspects of the society. Virtually every moment was captivating.,positive
An Interesting Bold Move. . . . I did definitely enjoy this moive for sure... especially being one who isn't particularly big on Nigerian (or do I still say Nollywood?) movies,positive
Pleasantly surprised,positive
"A huge step in Nigeria's Movie Industry. . . . The cast were good. All portrayed their roles well enough, it was almost seamless. This says a lot for most Nigerian movies",positive
"Cinematography was crystal. Star-studded, the acting was top-notch and touched on issues bedevilling Nigeria as a nation.",positive
So relatable for Africans in the diaspora. . . . Spoke to my own experience if being a African not living in Africa and trying so  to find belonging in a new home. Fantastic film!,positive
Shows corruption in its splendor,positive
This film is is a true story and is aposlutely brilliant and moving.,positive
"Absolutely horrendous. . Storyline is absolutely the worst, could not bring myself to watch till the end..",negative
"Most times, not enough effort is put into storytelling. This movie is ridiculous!",negative
"If somehow, If you know anyone deserving of your punishment, just buy them a ticket.",negative
One of the worst. . . . With the hype I would expect a great movie but this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a while.,negative
"I was kind of digging it at first but the movie has pacing issues, needs to be edited, and is way too long.",negative
Does anyone else agree the lead looks like a cross between Anthony Mackie and Daniel Kaluuya?,negative
an absurd movie,negative
The Call' is awesomely retarded.,negative
"Everything seems off-target, minor, as though the story (which is at times unforgivably unclear) isn't being dramatised so much as merely acted out and hurried through.",negative
"Not recommended for anybody. Not even children. Very irritating movie, 'Another Father's Day' will leave you with a migraine. With terrible acting and an outstandingly imbecilic story-line, this ridiculous low grade Disney wannabe excuse of a comedy will make anyone and everyone lose interest in Nollywood forever. Such a sham. And a terrible waste, this is what comes of writing stories and producing movies with the sole intention of advertising an amusement park, but people shouldn't have to pay to watch long-form adverts. We strongly suggest you stay far away from this filth if you value your time and energy.",negative
29 out of 100,negative
Missed opportunity,negative
"Complete waste of 2hours. . Not what I expected, and the movie is filled with utter annoying and dry humour.",negative
The story didn't really do much for me and became extremely predictable and repetitive by the end,negative
"Waste of time. . Wasn't really a clear plot, didn't make sence and just having a Nigerian man cussing a Jamaican cuss word is not Jamaica??",negative
"Not by the film's good use of humour, performances, fights and chases, but by how bad it is, and then you wonder",negative
"A rom-com where...the kitchen, hotel and country we see here don't feel cooked in, lived in or loved in.",negative
I would like to be... a terrorist . . Funniest shit watched in a long time,negative
Not fantastic. It's entertaining. Not spectacular.,negative
Not Recommended. Intriguing story unfortunately told by insufficient talent.,negative
I wanted to like this movie. . But I just couldn't. Slow -moving but still predictable. Too bad.,negative
"Sorry, very poor in all aspects. . What a terrible waste of almost 2hrs of my life.",negative
Midnight Crew' is yet another repulsively ugly Nollywood comedy to avoid at the cinemas.,negative
Another good potential ruined by bad writing.,negative
Papa Ajasco comes to cinema in this exceptionally ridiculous and ostentatiously foolish comedy.,negative
"I really wanted to like this film. I liked most of the actors and the production quality was good, but even though it was only 1 hr 34 it seemed to drag on forever. I had to stop and start this movie a few times. I finally finished it after a couple of months.",negative
I hate that iwasted my time watching this movie,negative
Sadly there's too much soundtrack used throughout the film and it has the effect of making the movie feel thirty-year old.,negative
Does not live up to Production Value,negative
complete rubbish,negative
"it was so bad that it totaly lost the tone of the first scene, that wasn't that good but has so much more to offer.",negative
Bad movie,negative
Good until the end. . Horrible mistake!,negative
expected much more,negative
"At approximately two hours long, the far majority of 'God Calling' is unexciting, bland and dreary.",negative
Wasted potential. . I left the theater in disgusted disappointment.,negative
This is the worst film I have ever seen.,negative
"Weak dialogue, amateurish battle scenes.",negative
"Fine Wine could have been more exciting, but the potential of the story was not fully explored and it was further marred by a very sluggish pace.",negative
Absolutely Not Recommended.,negative
Overhyped Uninteresting Movie. . . The character development is quite poor as viewers may be irritated with some.,negative
"Despite being produced by Zeb Ejiro and directed by Chico Ejiro, two Nollywood Goliaths, this 'Night Bus to Lagos' fails to arrive safely. the nineties. A complete waste of mone.",negative
not recommended. With zero originality and even less authenticity.,negative
very bad movie,negative
Fresh. Bold. Salacious. Illogical. Dissatisfying.,negative
"One-way traffic plot, average movie at best.. . . . Lionheart was a movie that generated a lot of buzz in the Nollywood industry. Considering the international support it got from Netflix, I was particularly excited to see how this movie went.. . . . From the get go the movie wears an indigenous look with local scenery and an instant banter in local language.. . . . However, it was one way traffic from there onwards, as the movie progressed.. . . . The plot is totally bare and overly predictable, and I'm still reeling from the shock of this being a comedy film.. . . . However, I still applaud the production quality of this film as it was great and a large chunk of the headline cast delivered on their script-save for Peter Okoye who was highly disappointing.. . . . For a directorial debut, one can only applaud the courage of Genevieve in pulling off this movie.. . . . On a final note, you are not guaranteed to have a good time watching this, and do not expect any fireworks.",negative
i have a thing against films with the characters and setting being foreign,negative
a movie with high rated actors but it was poorly executed,negative
Not Recommended. 'Dejavu' is a typical Yoruba film.,negative
Not Recommended for cinema. This movie is stressful.,negative

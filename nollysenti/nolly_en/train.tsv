review	sentiment
A steamy soap opera unfolding against the backdrop of a cautionary history lesson reminding us that in Nigeria, the more things change, the more they stay insane.	positive
An enormous amount of work and scrutiny went into making this. Such an enormous amount, its quality stands out easily and brazenly. The sheer amount of authenticity is simply breathtaking.	positive
My Village People is a movie that will have you losing your home training while watching it. But it is a pathfinder of sorts. Nollywood generally has not done a good job of making the supernatural sexy and appealing. My Village People achieves it effortlessly, and deserves copious amount of praise.	positive
The story is nothing we haven't seen before but its told from a Nigerian perspective, its funny, quirky and the dialogue is great when compared with others available in the Nigerian market.. . . . I totally enjoyed the movie, would definitely recommend (to my Naija folks!).	positive
1980's, drug mules, beautiful black women ... I'm in heaven	positive
Realistic but slow pacing and very melodramatic.. . . . Good acting, based on true events and a decent story. The pacing was a little too slow for my liking and some scenes feel like a made-for-tv movie (the cheese music and the over dramatization).. . . . Overall watchable if you know what you are getting into ahead of time.	positive
Correction.. . . . Thanks for this. I am impressed with it. But I Nelson Orah played the character of Ahmed, not Umar. I will appreciate it if it is corrected.	positive
She is' Super Fantastic! You want to see this movie. This movie is extraordinarily enjoyable. Pure Nollywood sweetness.	positive
I was thrilled after watching the movie, everything was on point. I was particularly impressed with the quality of the cast and crew. The director, Kemi Adetiba did a great job and I'm so proud of her. I have recommended it to so many people. I look forward to watching more of her work.	positive
Genevieve Nnaji stamps her foot concretely in the pantheon of genuis directors. She doesn't disappoint in her debut, Lion Heart. It's a must watch, as it announces the birth of an international Nollywood.	positive
Nollywood at its peak!!!!. . . . This movie tells a story about culture, unity and family. So many themes that I can't finish mentioning.	positive
A Good and Wise film. It was a good film, that shows the dangers of Nigerian tribalism and how it can affect a young love.	positive
this movie is a good offering in the genre.	positive
Loved this Movie. . . . I was really surprised to read negative reviews for this movie. Do we truly know what a good movie is? This movie was really good, very enjoyable. Well developed characters, believable and relatable story line. And the quality, fantastic. Well done guys. Loved it even more than wedding party 1 and 2. I am not disappointed at all.	positive
Saw the PremiereÃÅ in Houston Texas. . . . This movie should win an Oscar Award. The Storyline is so good. The Actors wereÃÅ all incredible.	positive
Anyone who loves art, Who's seen part one will know the plot and storyline was already built dEreÃÅ and this was a follow up.	positive
Great outcome.	positive
Expository Movie. . . . This is a very good and distinct movie. Some people might not like it perhaps because they are used to the love or thriller story films or perhaps because they are not used to life with a vehicle. They movie truly shows how things really are in the life of mechanics, apprentices and customers. It also teachers parents and children a good lesson. It is a seemingly perfect expository movie.	positive
Understated, powerful crime drama with historical flavor. . This was a very character rich film. Not a single scene was wasted.	positive
Great continuity throughout the movie... The writer and director is highly intelligent and creative. Thank you so much for this amazing movie	positive
I enjoyed seeing very good parts of Lagos, both on the mainland and the island, used, unlike other movies that stay in one location. Lagos is a beautiful place to shoot a movie, especially if the diversity of the state is put to use, as seen here. Accident scenes are usually tricky for Nollywood to portray, but it was a pleasant surprise to see a very believable one here.	positive
Citation the movie. . Perfect Movie. Loved every second of the movie. Wished it didn't end	positive
Akinnuoye-Agbaje's directorial debut is a troubling coming-of-age story based upon the directors own experiences as a 'farmed out' Nigerian child in the UK during a period of surging xenophobia in the wake of the Windrush generations arrival. The look and feel of the films early moments present a setting and characters so raw and realistic that one could only capture from having experienced them. The pacing of the film in many ways reflects this. At times seeming to take on an almost frantic pace which is meaningful in a way that captures the effect of somebody recalling their life story - made up of the important details and traumatic moments - though occasionally making it difficult to capture and appreciate the passage of time bordering on surreal. The supporting characters similarly are raw and identifiable foils though lacking in the depth required to be whole characters beyond their interactions with the film's lead. Furthermore the film does little to address or contextualize its setting, deliberately choosing to focus on the internal struggles of it's central character. Despite this the films central character is compelling enough to keep the viewer engaged solely in his development throughout the film. Overall Farming is an impressive directorial debut that tackles issues of dual identity and self-hatred in a manner that leaves plenty unsaid but provides a bitter and frequently heartbreaking account of an individuals struggle for meaning and identity. There is so much to be admired about this film which presents an often overlooked period in British history, the importance of such a personal topic deserving of a greater run-time than the films mere 107 minutes.	positive
amazing film must see	positive
Good series. . I really like this show. All the characters are great and I enjoy watching. Hope it stay around for more seasons. Looking forward to the next season!!!	positive
Working from a script by playwright Darci Picoult, Dosunmu fashions a tale that‚Äôs realistic, melodramatic and culturally specific (we spend as much time ogling colorfully patterned dresses as we do admiring Gurira‚Äôs endlessly expressive face), yet unmistakably archetypal.	positive
Great movie!	positive
No words to describe the power of this movie and its reminder of how fortunate it is to have never lived through a civil war. Extraordinary story telling of tragic, recent Nigerian history and the humanity within it all.	positive
Beautiful	positive
Rational representation of the Igbos. . . . Lion heart represented what it really means to be Igbo - hard-working and communal system of living.	positive
There is a lot of mediocre acting here and there and some things made little to no sense for me but overall i did enjoy it for what it is. I would probably not watch it ever again but seeing it once is nice.	positive
While the themes here are, of course, redolent of neorealism, the filmmakers don‚Äôt make ostentatious nods to cinema past. Their voice is their own; the camera is mobile when it needs to be, but stands still much of the time, letting the excellent cast build their characters as the events of the film test their endurance.	positive
Funny Funny Funny. . . . Oh mehn, this movie is super funny. if you are looking for a movie to lift your mood up then this is the right movie for you.	positive
Superb movie!!. . This has got to be the best made movie to come out of Nigeria, not to mention hilariously funny!	positive
BEAUTIFUL AFRICAN WOMEN	positive
I don't know on what basis people have given this movie such a low rating but believe me after a long time I've a watched such a good, cute, clean and better than Bollywood movie.	positive
The picture quality of this movie is great, and the director did a good job.	positive
Outstanding performance. . . . Temi Otedola's performance was truly stunning. I thoroughly enjoyed the layers that the story had and the way that each key piece of information was revealed.	positive
A Major Step in taking back our narrative. . . . This movie, has really showed a deep side of the struggles of the people we often ignore. Easy to see a person to judge, but when stories like these are told you start to look at everyone with a different lens. The ending, though abrupt keeps you in a limbo and holds you in a powerful suspense pondering on what you just witnessed.	positive
Spot On!!! üî•üî•üî•. . Definitely African movie of the year, enjoyed every minute of the 2hours 30minutes üòÄüëèüëèüëèüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•‚úî‚úå	positive
A rare story about the values of family from a very distinctive perspective. Eloquently interpreted with perfect casting	positive
Finally a great Nigerian film. For years I‚Äôve been hoping that Nigeria would produce a really great film, and that‚Äôs where the Esiri brothers come in.	positive
Honestly this movie is really good production wise and the sequel. Chills from top notch acting.	positive
Hardly was there a period of 5 minute in this movie with nothing to smile, chuckle or laugh about. I don't think there is a Nigerian movie that beats this in it's genre (Fictional Comedy). The movie effects were as well commendable.	positive
Good Nollywood romantic comedy. . This movie is exactly cheesy enough to make you smile after a bad day.	positive
Nice cross-country movie. . . . The only thing that I don't like about this movie is the way there was little or no interaction with the Nigerian or Indian environment.. . . . Beautiful romantic movie.	positive
The story starts a bit slow but stick with it. Very good story.	positive
King of Boys. . . . This series is absolutely fantastic, from the story line to the cast, costumes and the emotion portrayed by the protagonist. I'm sure proud to be a Nigerian at this time. Well done Kemi Adetiba, well done Sola Sobowale!	positive
A must see for everyone. . . . Namaste wahala is a masterpiece and officially a cross between cultures. This Nollywood Bollywood collaboration have everything in a good romantic movie should have, the indian actors wereÃÅ all great and played their roles perfectly.	positive
Realistic, entertaining and all round good vibes. I could watch it all day. I wish they would air more than once a week though, asides from that, its just great. Most reality shows come off as scripted but not this one.	positive
On a Nollywood scale I'll give this movie an 9 because of it's unique storyline and excellent production which sets it aside from other Nigerian movies	positive
Good story line. . . . It's a good movie and storyline. Loved it.	positive
Speechless;. . . . This movie gave me goose bumps I connected in a way that literally tore my soul. Indeed depicted God the way and manner it should God bless the writer, producers and all involved. The actors too are top top everyone did a fantastic job.	positive
I enjoyed the relationship crafted between Mr. Tayo (Bimbo Manuel) and Ejiro (RMD),	positive
One thing I like about the movie is the way the story was told and the ways the actors interpreted it. The writers, directors and cinematographers deserve an applaud for this effort. 	positive
Best Christian Movie!!!. . . . I love this movie! It's so well done - The acting was awesome and the storyline was refreshing. Kudos to the entire cast and crew! Definitely a must-watch!. . . . P. S. You'll need tissues.	positive
Love it!. . I love the movie, the actors , the director etc. Everyone absolutely made it great with their acting skill. . . . Anyone who finds it bad doesn't clearly know a good movie, and possibly can't relate with our cultures.	positive
Awesome. . . . The movie was awesome with beautiful characters. I love seeing Bisola in movies, she's good.	positive
Beautiful acting, beautiful directing, not so great story. . I had to open an account just to review this movie. This is a beautiful work of art.. . 	positive
Interesting. . . . I really enjoyed this movie. The acting and story line was really good. I found it to be very interesting to wonder about Ishi's life - this for sure is an eye opener to so many who are forced into marriage.	positive
Gabriel Afolayan is in a class of his own as an actor; he always understands the task.	positive
Not as Bad as reviewed.	positive
Great film and great action. . . . Great story original great action and great comedy all combined in one. Thrilling film and great cast.	positive
A well-acted, finely wrought epic that nevertheless struggles to balance the requirements of melodrama with its drive to capture a historical moment.	positive
Awesome. . . . The first time I saw this movie I was blown away. I don't want to sound crazy but I try to study things of this world. I hope to see a second installment with the same characters and a darker plot.	positive
Amazing. . I'd of normally flicked past this, but honestly it's an amazing story. You can tell it had a low budget, but the direction and screen play is fantastic! The choreography of the fight scenes lacked a little. Worth a watch definitely	positive
Engrossing tale of family and war. . . . I recommend this movie without reservation.	positive
Wow. . . . This movie really made me change my relationship for the best. Great movie. The movie did start off slow but it definitely kept me interested. The flash backs really made the ending even more intense because everything came together.	positive
People will never learn if they don't even try.. . . . This movie tackles so many issues including the biggest one of all. Identity Crisis in Black men.	positive
Through an economy of exposition, Eyimofe, (translated as ‚ÄúThis is My Desire‚Äù) delivers a timeless, universal portrait of human resilience while establishing Arie and Chuko as a welcome new addition to the filmmaking brood.	positive
it is a great movie from someone whom we know to be a great storyteller. Gold Statue may not be one of Tade Ogidan‚Äôs best works, but it ranks high up there	positive
Nice movie. . . . Great story line. It was worth watching. I certainly would recommend watching it.	positive
This was fun to watch. . . . The Delivery Boy is very refreshing, a beautiful story, told brilliantly. You should see it!	positive
This show should have 5 seasons!!!!. . . . This show was so interesting and entertaining. If the real Caliphate has a problem with it. Change or abbreviate the name, abeg. Great cast!!! Great writing!!! Great visuals. :)	positive
Great movie. . . . I cannot for the life of me understand the low reviews for such a remarkable film. This series was so good that I binged the entire series as a Medical Student. Great work and thumbs up to the producer and casts.	positive
The production was great a d light years ahead of most of the sub-par movies of African cinema. This movie is truly a great step in the right direction for Afican cinema.	positive
Entertaining live concert featuring lively arrangements of jazz and pop standards and an excellent orchestra	positive
This return of the king is glorious.	positive
Great job!!	positive
Well crafted, highly personal story told with superb acting	positive
Still one of the Best Nigerian films of 2017. . Isoken is a great film showcasing the culture of the area of the country. The layout, filming, colors and dressing tell much of the tradition quite well. The film has quite a good inject of laughter and great acting.. . 	positive
Great watch. . . . Great movie! I enjoyed the fact that they promoted the Igbo language!	positive
"Hand-held camera chases, emotionally fraught close-ups, arresting compositions and a script that gives a familiar story a distinctly African flavor make ""√íl√≤t≈´r√©"" a thriller you not only endure but marvel over and embrace."	positive
You need to watch this!!!!!. . . . A must watch!!! I'm in love with the character The plot Literally everything	positive
fantastic movie	positive
I love you - I have a baby‚Ä¶	positive
A great piece of work by Kemi Adetiba, the story was well scripted, good cinematography, all actors gave a great performance. This is a world class movie... Kudos to the all the crews	positive
Powerful film of a totally forgotten episode in history; not for the faint of heart.	positive
Great film - entertained and educated	positive
serious drama with subtle comedy, my type	positive
Wow, this true story! Wow! Amazing. . . . Wow this story! The many many many stories of the Black experience throughout the African diaspora, and throughout generations. I am so glad our Brotha shared his story and got to write, direct, star in. And Damson wow, his acting is always amazing.	positive
Impressive & funny how they portrayed both cultures. I was entertained all through! Clean cut production.	positive
Excellent delivery. . . . The movie is a wonderful delivery of the sexual assaults on university female student by some lecturer. It passes the message in a simple unsuspecting manner. Unpredictable end however, a few forgivable misses	positive
Amazing. . . . Loved the display if pure culture even in the music. Great to see the people who made me watch nollywood movies again. All round thrilling and very funny..	positive
Fantastic Series from Nigeria. . . . I love this series. Great scenery. Fantastic acting. Everybody was giving their A game. The jokes were natural and very relatable. It was educative as well.	positive
Hits the right note. . The language is Street, the cast stellar, cinematography and editing is on point. It also has a great plot. Best of all it puts Ajegunle on the map.	positive
New Pandemic that could happen again!. . . . It's a a brilliant movie and very realistic about what really happened. It's better than the movie Contagion in my book. It really hit close to home for me. It's one of the first serious pandemic in my lifetime. I would really like to purchase this movie on DVD and I've been look in the US but to no avail. Can someone tell me how? Thanks	positive
How does a movie with this subject matter wind up being this slow and boring? Where is the urgency? Where is the suspense and tension? The editing and the pacing drove me nuts and there's just no way this thing needed to be nearly two and half hours long. And that's really a shame because it highlights a really big and important problem, I just wish it did so without putting the audience to sleep.	positive
Lionheart is such a beautiful movieüëè. . . . This movie is the best Nollywood movie I've seen so far. Every scene was precise, beautiful and with a touch of humour and a moral lesson. I like that Nigeria was well represented.	positive
Season 2. . . . I loved Season 1 and I could hardly wait for Season 2. I like all the characters. So hopefully you'll keep bringing on the new Series.	positive
"It was a 2hours movie that I rather shouldn't call entertainment but a moment of empowerment. If I was having doubts, my conviction got better... I was able to connect with the movie because obviously, I have experienced a touch of God before.. . . . I say ""yes"" again to God's call."	positive
It almost accurately portrayed the abuses a lot female students face in Nigerian universities and west Africa at large	positive
Colorful and detailing but thrilling isn't the word. . . . In general, Fifty is standard, beautiful and lively, it is expected to be thrilling at the end but the goose in my pimples didn't show off much but I was happy remembering few lines and scenes at the end.	positive
Kunle Afo's most impactful movie so far... . . . The movie address a topic that is very fundamental in Nigeria Education system. Good story line, interesting plot, fantastic acting. This movie is one of the best you will ever watch on topics bothering on gender based violence in Africans higher institutions. Just enjoy it and firm your unbiased review! It's a cool one	positive
A Brilliant Movie. . . . Just watched Lara and the Beat on Netflix. This film is wonderful. Beautiful cinematography, on point acting, a great story, nice music and wholesome entertainment that the whole family can enjoy.	positive
Refreshing. . Loved everything about it. The culture, language and music were beautiful.	positive
The movie authentically gives us the feel of the eighties, up to how parties were organized, the talk about bleaching, the clothes, and the generous use of damask and adire.	positive
It's a well paced movie, filled with properly fleshed out characters operating in a plot structure that doesn't fall apart. The film. is brought o life with a stunning aesthetic and masterful cinematography. The story, although not phenomenal, is good enough to keep you glued to your seat while imparting a thing or two about the subject matter.	positive
"Season 2 Please!. . . . I watched ""Fifty Series"" and came upon Castle & Castle because of Tola face was familiar. I love this series and would love for a season 2 to come! I just hate that if left me hanging on the last episode, like a season 2 would be coming. So please give us a season 2!!"	positive
Terrific film!. . . . This is an intense, heartbreaking family drama with an excellent script and stellar acting performances.	positive
Light and funny!. . An absolute comedy gold with a great plot-line. From the sisters to the villains, this is a must watch! Not the mention the unexpected fantasy elements and great special effects! Highly recommended.	positive
They took a risk but the execution from production to acting was very well done.	positive
Farming may not be the best-executed story, but with a captivating performance by Damson Idris, nevertheless, it is still a story worth telling.	positive
SUPERBLY REFRESHING!!!. . . . Everything about this movie was just on POINT! The story line, characters and directing..down to costumes. I absolutely enjoyed this!! My popcorn was out in minutes! Love love love! Please make more movies!!!	positive
Nice cross-country movie. . . . The only thing that I don't like about this movie is the way there was little or no interaction with the Nigerian or Indian environment.. . . . Beautiful romantic movie.	positive
Amazing movie. . . . I loved loved watching this movie with its excellent plot, screenplay directing and Dakore and the cast delivered so well on the acting. Our culture and heritage was fully represented.Oscar worthy if it was in indigenous category. Definitely a 10/10 for me	positive
A fantastic movie!!! Wow wow wow. Nollywood has ascended.	positive
Brilliant. . . . Good story line that requires so much attention. But overall, the movie is well done.	positive
Great Movie from Nollywood.. . . . Lionheart wasn't just written for the sake of it. It portrayed so many things going on in Nigeria that it'll take one with in-depth and an open mind to see through the movie.	positive
This is by far the best production from nollywood! It looks more like an African American film. The acting is top notch and to find out it is the lead actresses first film, thumbs up.	positive
Something like a Shakespearean comedy, full of highly amusing, sharply drawn characters and offering wicked insight into how identity is shaped by city living and immigrant culture clash.	positive
Nigerians in Brooklyn. . . . This is an amazing film, suspenseful, thoughtful, and colorful.	positive
Temi Otedola did amazing job!	positive
Thank you for a perfect example of how HE works in our lives: This movie is a gut-wrencher, reminding us how He works through imperfect, repentant people who are only called to obey Him. He does the rest. He is faithful to complete what He has started. What a GOD honoring movie, showing the Triune in goodness and glory and power. Thank you.	positive
Stroyline was beautiful. . . . The plot twist was everything. Suspense filled. Gripping and interesting. Touched a lot on the importance of communication in relationships. I'll watch it over and over again.	positive
I love this film! I've watched it several times. I hope another one is in the works	positive
A Modern Nigerian Classic. . . . . . Nollywood truly has a political/religious/tribal gem here for those who seek to broaden their perceptions of the whys of the major ills of the world & in this case a small community in Nigeria - r so pervasive today.. . . . Soul comes to this physical reality for experiences & this film delivers a ton of them‚ù§	positive
Fun to watch especially if u understand the Igbo language... But in general it's a good and interesting movie..	positive
This movie feels like a mish mash of under-developed ideas with a half hearted romance thrown in. It is not sure if it wants to be a comedy or a satire.	positive
Genevieve Nnaji proves yet again while she's still the best Nollywood actress of all time with her directing debut. we can only say more grease	positive
A film which captured a nation's hope for better cinema. . . . One can only wish that other Nigerian filmmakers will build on this same ground for a much brighter Nigerian film future.	positive
Absolutely sensational. . . . This made me feel proud to be Nigerian. Storyline aside, the performances from each character wEreÃÅ phenomenal and really captured my attention.	positive
Searching for a soundtrack & review. . . . There'se a soundtrack at the end of the movie. On the background. It contains no words, it's more a melody. I'm trying to find the name of it.. . . . Beside that, great movie, really slow paced. Acting is realistic. No absurb emotions or anything like that. The conversations, the choosen words, the evens, the chemistry. It looks natural like you're watching a real situation. There's alot of silent moments and stuff like that. So you either like this type of movies, or you don't	positive
my number one nigeria sci fi best movie. . I love the movie, it falls into my favorite type which i am satisfy off, looking forward for nigeria to bring more to screen.. . . . And my advice for us Nigerian is to support this movie to encourage them to bring and produce more better movies of our choice for us to watch.	positive
Kemi Adetiba's King of Boys is exceptional. From the selection of cast to the well executed story line, this movie is nothing short of excellent. The thrill, plot twists, humor, unpredictability are unmatched.	positive
Perfection. . . . Someone should please help me find a mistake in this movie because I have watched it four times and still I can't find one. Everything about the movie was perfect. The movie is an original.	positive
This film is is a true story and is absolutely brilliant and moving.	positive
A Refreshing Nigerian Series. . . . Such a refreshing Nigerian series to watch without the awful music playing throughout the movie. However. I don't like that Netflix just carried Season 1, got me piqued and their is no season 2 to be found.	positive
If it were food I would say mouth watering. . . . The film citation is a necessity, I do not see where it would ever run out of relevance. The actors were carefully picked and displayed such professionalism, the location were amazing never new had such good universities in Senegal , the arts and craft of our African leaders carved out the African identity.. . . . The message this movie carries, how it was told is so special, insightful and artistic. The suspense is on another level, the melange of feelings it creates to us the viewers is something else.. . . . Citation is a must watch go watch it on NETFLIX	positive
Excellent Film. . . . This was a great film. A very simple storyline that provides a glimpse into the past to two boys (with many unknowns).. then the twists and turns that surround their reunion as grown men.. . . . Well done! So different from anything I've ever scene.	positive
Loved it. . . . ... beautiful movie ... i love my Nigerians. Beautiful storyline too . Well done	positive
Beautiful, beautiful, sad and necessary.	positive
My Village People delivered fantastic special effects, and they are not over the top. One of my favourite special effects is the rain. The technical crew deserves special recognition for their skills in this movie	positive
Historic, Thrilling, Educative and Awesome	positive
This is my favourite Nigerian film. Really enthralling debut feature.	positive
I deeply appreciated seeing a movie with an emotional bond between two sisters who were connected in so many ways, but disconnected by romance and political views. The movie actors were superb and each character was perfectly cast for their roles.	positive
An Educational But Visceral & harrowing Film Expertly Crafted. . It's A great movie well acted and Directed Expertly Crafted while Being educational to a degree but it's a fully immersive visceral experience .. . . . Exploring Race ,and Gang Culture ,in England it's hard to believe some of these things Knowing that it was based on true story makes it and even tougher pill to swallow .Maybe a few scenes are for theatrical licence but still it comes from some where real .. . . . There's so many point in the film where i'd just ask why ? why would you do that ! Nooo !. . . . it's not for the faint hearted and it kind of messes with your mind it's the kind of movie that will leave you with many questions. . . . entertaining but thought provoking and intriguing A work of art One of the Most Original Movies I've seen in ages a refreshing perspective Definitely worth a watch	positive
It was a nice, wholesome movie about Love, Faith, Family and temptations of the world.......was a bit cheesy, but I enjoyed it. Fell in love with Mawuli Gavor and would watch it again just to see him..	positive
Beautiful movie depicting historic events in Benin kingdom. . . . This movie was very educational and intereÃÅsting to watch. I am still in shock it was done in 2014. The acting and directing was superb. . Kudos to the cast and crew.	positive
Great concept. . . . Creative storyline with talented actors. A bit excessive with some of the flashbacks but still very interesting throughout.	positive
Authentic!. . . . This movie had so many parts that were real!. . . . People do borrow clothes and cars and pose with them, lie through their teeth to drum up business and people do learn from their mistakes and extend a helping hand.. . . . It was a great comedy with some good lessons including- don't believe the glitter!	positive
These people deserve a whole fucking lot of credit for this movie. The writing is eh. Performances are eh. But so, so hard, and they did it. You have to appreciate that. Also, this is not the Nigerian movie. This is a one-shot rom-com about twenty-something white people.	positive
Do-mi-til-la!. . . . Domitilla is a landmark film in the Nigerian home video industry	positive
Amazing!. . The Director and the producers did amazing work on this movie.	positive
An Intelligent Film. . . . This is a Film that gives an introspect into the degradation of surrealism and spiritual elements in the African society due to environmental pollution. This goes to show how the physical greatly affects the spiritual and vice versa. This is a really good movie to see.	positive
Heartwarming, good natured film. . . . Appreciated the message about the universality of love and the way the film goes on to show the value of the protagonist in a professional, moral capacity as well as a her beauty.	positive
Simply the best so far. . Not surprise that it is Kemi Adetiba on this one but everything about the film is the best of its kind so far in Nollywood. Of course there enough room for improvement. Cinematography was top notch but most impressive is the interpretation of the story.	positive
Great movie. . . . In terms of acting, this is one of the greatest movie I have watched. It took me back to the days of classical Nigerian movies wEreÃÅ the acting was so pure and detailed. The storyline is immersive, and intriguing. Great movie.	positive
"Two Thumbs Up. ""Isoken meets Something New"""	positive
The best of the movie finds a way to abridge the novel and still allow the scenes to breathe.	positive
I enjoyed the movie, and its overall message, that was frankly superimposed at all times. but the movie had a positive and optimistic message, so i found story development and everything to be appropriate.	positive
A story told like no other. . It's a quality movie, watch it with an open mind.	positive
Wow! Netflix finally picked up something good.	positive
Gem of a documentary, educational, hilarious, heartfelt, basically an emotional rollercoaster.	positive
The movie is well paced and has good, short scenes that pass across the message succinctly.	positive
It's a really nice movie..	positive
Level Up!. . . . Nollywood movies are getting up where we want it. I loved the acting, storyline & casting line-up of this movie. Its a good romcom in a Naija way!. . . . Nice acting y' all.	positive
"flawed but enjoyable (and important). . . . A faithful adaptation of one of the novels that began modern Hausa literature in the colonial period, by the future Prime Minister of Nigeria, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa. The acting is a bit stilted at times, and the director betrays his training in documentaries. But Hausa (or ""Haoussa"" as they spell it in most of the French speaking countries) is the largest language in Africa south of the Sahara, and if you are at all curious to see a Hausa movie, or real African film, this is one to see.. . . . When I saw it in the States with a friend we watched a long dialogue at the beginning, followed by subtitles which translated the exchange with two words: ""Hello."" and ""Hello."". . . . My friend leaned over and whispered ""What did they say?"". . . . ""That was it."" I explained ""That was 'hello' in Hausa."". . . . It may not always make sense to you, but to the Hausa this movie was a hit, and remains a classic, ""must see"" Hausa film."	positive
Cute and romantic movie. . . . I love the characters and how they unfold. Really sweet and relaxing movie. Think Love Jones.	positive
The character is bold and over the top as she should be, but Ms. Adetiba knows how to operate with directorial constraint. Kudos!. . I will recommend it highly to all whom I know.	positive
An amazing piece of work. . . . Truly, I went into the movie not really expecting much but I was pleasantly surprise. There are some scenes i am yet to recover from. Beautiful piece of work, stuff that classics are made of. I am really going to see it again!	positive
A Simple Story But Well Executed. . I would recommend the movie. It was solidly good and well worth watching	positive
Nice cross-country movie. . . . The only thing that I don't like about this movie is the way there was little or no interaction with the Nigerian or Indian environment.. . . . Beautiful romantic movie.	positive
Amusing and uplifting, without ever being sentimental, Nnaji clearly has a bright future in the director's chair.	positive
A must watch. . . . A cute movie,seye had qualities of what any woman will want...and if you want to watch something with the girl's I'll recommend this one.a decent movie that one can watch with they family.	positive
All I can say is that this movie is my movie of the year!	positive
This movie is the bomb.	positive
Amazing movie. . . . This movie captured the troubles faced by the average Gen Z Nigerian kid. It did not gloss over anything. It left you sad and annoyed at some places. It left you triggered which I think was the point. To force the viewer to live the reality of the characters. I'm happy this story got told.	positive
Amazing and Crazy Hilarious. . This is the most hilarious movie I have come across this year. . . The acting, story, cinematography and directing are all on point. Super impressed.	positive
Fantastic lead acting. Left emotionally devastated. Story is powerful.	positive
Arie and Chuko Esiri‚Äôs film is understated in its attunement to the challenges of trying to escape a stagnant existence	positive
One of the best nollywood movie. . . . I really enjoyed the movie, i now know why it's is considered as the first ground breaking nollywood movie	positive
This Is The Best Political Series In Africa. . . . Let me start by saying kudos to every new members that made this outstanding political series possible	positive
Feel good movie. . Subtitles needed to get the finer details of the plot, but wonderful characters and a credit to another side of Nigeria never shown.	positive
Fun to watch. . . . Enjoyed watching this movie. Love the perspective of the writer and the visuals. Appreciate that it wasn't the typical Nollywood movie.	positive
Nice movie for the holidays. . . . A funny, spirited comedy that is thoroughly enjoyable to watch. Good acting, great use of settings, brings out the various dynamics of Nigerian family, friends, societal struggles and quests for love and money.	positive
It‚Äôs a powerfully sensual movie, gorgeously lensed colors and textures conveying its characters emotional states while thoughtfully exploring the range of human sexuality through Adenike‚Äôs experience.	positive
This was Surprisingly interesting. True story movies are almost always good.	positive
"Such a wonderful movie! From beginning to end it has you laughing, smiling, and crying. It really goes to show God's love and power even in our darkest and ""Last Days."" Many kudos to the cast (and producers) for a heart tugging film, their pain, suffering, love and triumphs were heartfelt throughout"	positive
So relatable for Africans in the diaspora. . . . Spoke to my own experience if being a African not living in Africa and trying so  to find belonging in a new home. Fantastic film!. .  . . 	positive
Very great movie.....it stimulates thoughts. There shouldn't be racial discrimination.	positive
Love it!!!. . . . Every movie from Kunle Afolayan is always a story we can all generally relate with. The storyline, natural acting , great casting is always something to watch out for. Citation has got a good story line with it's plots and twists describing natural causes in our lives. I would say, this is another amazing movie to watch.	positive
One of the best nollywood movie. . . . I really enjoyed the movie, i now know why it's is considered as the first ground breaking nollywood movie	positive
Actually Amazing. . It has everything. Binge watched the entire season. Brilliant cast and has useful legal information for their target audience. Educational, suspense filled, funny and relatable characters. What more can you ask for? It literally ticks al the boxes.	positive
Oh what a lovely film! As romance and history, this is by turns funny and tragic, suspenseful and celebratory, and never less than solidly entertaining.	positive
I  thought the movie was well done. It's subject matter however is deadly serious. Kudos to the dedicated men and women of Lagos	positive
Farming is a excellent film but my god is it a tough watch. . . . This was by far one of the best movies I have seen this year. I do not know why the rating is so bad. This movie is by far better than some of the movies that have received Oscars including Moonlight.. . . . Farming is an extremely tough movie to watch. Every scene comes down on you... Hard enough to either make you cry out in pain, anger or just good old plain frustration. I couldn't stop cursing!	positive
OMG How did I miss this show. . . . I am so wrapped up in this series. Love every comedy line..Stella that's my girl right there...phenomenal actress.	positive
A decent movie's chance taken away from destructive criticism.	positive
This was one hell of a ride. . . . I recommend this movie to anyone interested into this topic - or anyone who enjoy great movies! Go watch this movie, and hit like NOW!	positive
Amazing Movie!. . . . Enjoyed watching the entire time! Great Storyline.	positive
God called me........ . As He is my witness, I was guided to view this awesome movie yesterday. Even though I was looking for a movie for distraction, I was compelled to watch this extraordinarily crafted movie yesterday. It fell in line perfectly with the personal spiritual search I've been on lately. During the time I watched, answer after answer to so many questions came to me. I'm still astounded.. . . . Watch this, please, with an open mind.	positive
A film set in Africa about Africans - a nice change.. . . . It was refreshing to see a film set in Africa which was about the African people of today rather than the great white hunter and the colonial era	positive
Amazing Acting and Production. . . . Best out of Nollywood. Loved it. The acting the storyline.	positive
The best movie ever	positive
AN EXCELLENT SERIES!!. . . . This series had me just HOOKED within the first 20 mins. of the show! I just loved everything about it from beginning to end. Especially, the REAL-LIFE examples/reason the people needed lawyers. And, OMG! The laughter throughout this serious is non-stop.. I just hated for Season 1 to end.	positive
The 7 episode show went through the backstory of the African people and it really delves into the stories no one hears about and the unsung heroes that lead the Nigerian people to finding their independence.	positive
I'm blown...and still reeling from the story and production.	positive
Saw lion heart on the 24th of December, and also went to see it on the 31st of December, yes it's that good! Everyone gave it a standing ovation!	positive
Pleasant Surprise! Great Acting!!	positive
A must watch. . Beautiful romance movie. 	positive
Every scene carried the viewer along seamlessly. As one who does understand any language besides English,I highly recommend this movie and best of all its a movie you can watch again and again.	positive
Better than expected	positive
This story was a beautiful picture of the balance of joy and sorrow during the time of the Nigerian Civil War. I loved it and I would recommend it.	positive
Guess this may be the apex of nollywood cinema in many ways but as a beginner viewer it‚Äôs enjoyable nonetheless. Captured the chaotic nature and length of nollywood films with a novel storyline and a characteristic touch of Nigerian political culture	positive
A concrete jungle, criss-crossed by the endless mesh of electrical wiring - Lagos is brought to life.	positive
Living in Bondage the film that marked the start of Nollywood. I walked out of the theater strong in faith. And faith in Nigeria is what I have now.	positive
Beautiful movie. . . . It was an all round entertainer. Good job	positive
Captivating. . . . Zainab was captivating in her role as Sylvia. It left me hoping for a sequel. Throughout the twist and turns of the movie I could not help but be glued to the tv. I found myself pulling for Sylvia. Her seductiveness and witty demeanor was only surpassed by her outstanding acting skills.	positive
A fun-filled rollercoaster of emotions. . . . If you're an open-minded, hopeless romantic, you'll definitely enjoy watching this movie. I thought that the lead characters had great chemistry and the supporting cast delivered fine performances as well. It was interesting to see the clash of cultures exposed and finally resolved amicably. There's plenty of humour, drama and tense moments to hold your interest. Certainly makes my favourite list.	positive
"""Narradores de Jav√©"" is a funny and dramatic simple story supported by a good and original screenplay, great direction and excellent performances of the cast formed by actors, actresses and amateurish simple persons."	positive
I'd say: worth watching!. . . . Well made, well played, good actors, even though it might seem a bit slow at times (and over 2 hrs altogether), I still think it is worth watching anytime. Of course, it is not the brightest and happiest movie to watch during these corona and pandemic times.... . . . but I liked it.	positive
I appreciate this movie and even more, I appreciate all the doctors and nurses in the world for their noble and humble work ethics, risking their lives to save ours.	positive
Lara and the Beats was the authenic soul nurturing plate of REAL Jollof with plantains, smiles, and love. Hopefully now it will become viral on the small screen, and get all of the accolates it deserves. A must see multiple times.	positive
A Brilliant Series From Nigeria!!!. . I am so happy I came across this series. I enjoyed it thoroughly from the beginning to the end. I hope thEreÃÅ will be a season two.	positive
Hilarious & light hearted. . . . Chief Daddy is the type of movie you can watch over and over. The actors are fantastic, and the movie overall is a not-so-serious narration with valuable teachable moments. Sure there are a few plot holes that could have been handled better, but overall I would recommend.	positive
Originally Unoriginal. . . . The story has a lovely premise.. . I love this movie, but as an ardent observer of Western cinema, it feels like a copy.	positive
Very good, if not wholly fulfilling.	positive
It was beautifully directed. Nollywood is coming upüî•big time. The real definition of a set up, with mind blowing twist and turns.	positive
"Sadly accurate, disturbing but incredibly engaging.. . . . I grew up during this time period and sadly resonate with some of the issues which were brought up in this film. I have a close friend who also experienced ""farming"" and it still has repercussions in her and her family's life today. The film was sadly disturbing, but unfortunately accurate in a number of it's depictions of the era in the UK. I was shocked at the final revelation as to who Enitan is in real life, which definitely - as already explained by another reviewer - enhanced the emotional climax.. . . . Excellent, albeit sad, but well worth watching if only for the historical context."	positive
A true story of Human trafficking. This is told just as it is. Wow. Why is this movie rated 5? It's a 10/10. This is excellent. Oluture is just perfect. Terrific! Awesome	positive
Scattershot but still packing some impacts	positive
Great movie. Enjoyed every seconds of it. . An interesting story line and a big kudos to all the cast and crew of king of boys, thank you for this awesome movie.	positive
He said, she said	positive
Remarkable. . . . Citation is a blend of artistry work and talented personas	positive
Every single character in the movie did an excellent job.	positive
Accurate. . This movie talks about Nigeria and her politicians or politheivecians as I call them. Who are all jokers and comedians in a different area of life who decided to go into politics and toil with people's lives as much as they want entertain you on campaigns and forget what they were elected for. Big ups to the producers, actors and actresses, directors and the rest of the crew, nice movie budget especially when comparing it in the nollywood. Everything was nice but we would have loved if the movie was concluded in a way it should have been and not in suspense or another part or sequel to be released later on. Good movie especially if you are Nigerian and not interested in party or favouritism from the leaders. Just shows you the people we elect as leaders in this country are comedians who lack idea on how to rule a country. Once again big ups to everyone.	positive
I really enjoyed watching the movie. First time seeing Nollywood do something that can compete internationally.	positive
Brilliant movie. . This is a brilliant export from Nollywood. I am amazed at the level of quality of this film. Nigerian cinema is truly growing. Good job and we need a sequel.	positive
Not your everyday dilemma, but as depicted in this lushly detailed and passionately performed melodrama, the mores and traditions of this sequestered, seldom depicted group take on a broader relevance.	positive
A perfect story!. . . . Amazingly realistic. It depicts the life and story of young Nigerian men living in Lagos.	positive
Not my type of movie but my type of actors	positive
"Refreshing, New, Love Story!! This is one of the best love. funny, well acted stories I have seen for a while! I love the beautiful black actors, and enjoyed that it is just as good as the typical ""Hollywood"" made movies!!"	positive
The performances are so natural with this absolutely unobtrusive camera that speaks the language of the independent domestic drama - the parts of the story unfamiliar to me, I‚Äôm able to catch up with.	positive
Good movie, would love to see a continuation of this movie.	positive
excellent Performances~. . . . Well done! The performances by the entire cast was good, especially the actress who plays the mother along with the male and female lead. Would definitely watch more stories like this.	positive
I really enjoyed watching the movie. First time seeing Nollywood do something that can compete internationally.	positive
"Jumbled' is highly entertaining and exceptionally enjoyable. You will hate the characters, then you will love them, then hate them and love them again. 'Jumbled' is that special type of movie Nigerians love to love. You know, the type where one minute, you are going- ""This guy is so stupid."" The next, you are like ""Awww"". And not too long after that, your ""Awww"" quickly turns to ""Hehn? My God!"" Fantastic movie. Not perfect. But fantastic all the same."	positive
I enjoyed this movie üé•! Great acting and a different twist ending!üëç	positive
Nollywood blockbuster that turns out to be a sprawling, at times gloriously chaotic gangster epic about a woman who made it and who now rules the world by way of her facial expressions. So much energy.	positive
This movie will englighten you. . . . As a Nigerian I know we have three major tribes: Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. However, you don't hear the mention of Hausa in places like America. Hausa's are termed the poorest-illiterates in the country. You hardly see or hear them in entertainment so the world isn't aware they even exist. I wish they will make more movies like this. The Hausa tribe needs to be heard!	positive
Loved this movie- the cinematography, the shots, the fashion and music was on point. Lagos looks sooooo good. The acting was very believable and I enjoyed humor in unexpected scenes like well- find out for yourself.	positive
We need season 2!!!. . . . I binge watched season one. It was awesome.	positive
This was a good write, a good direct, a great watch, marvellous delivery, an elegant cast, a tasty plot!!!	positive
Under Rated. . . . Good cast, good storyline. It's as real as things seem in Africa. Good watch	positive
Absolutely Stunning Picture. . . . Overall I loved the movie in it's entirety and hope more directors and producers can provide more movies reading between the lines of historic events.	positive
Loved It All! Awesome Actresses! Entertaining Fashionable & Educational!!! These writers and directors were so on point. This series had me begging for more. I'm a major fan of these women and men now. More, Please!	positive
"Very well written & performed.. . . . This was quite an original take on the common subject of infidelity. The plot was very well thought out; interesting and the pacing kept me engaged from the very beginning. It would throw me off from any predictability in fairly creative ways at well spaced out intervals throughout its nice length and the acting was of a decent standard from everyone too. The ending sealed this movie off really nicely and the moral lessons are sound.. . . . On another note, I am so impressed by Nollywood movies nowadays. The storytelling and themes in general are leading the way for ""black movies"" because they have simply advanced way past the obvious notion that the cast or setting is black-orientated and instead they just focus more on everyday life without those patronising caricatures. So refreshing!. . . . Quick note the editor: Less warp stabiliser."	positive
...contains memorable scenes and definitely, er, packs a punch, but it is marred by gauche directorial touches‚Ä¶	positive
Amazing movie. . . . It was a wow movie, from the cast to the storyline.. it was flowing, it gave all the emotions high and low.. such a beautifully written movie. Worth every cent..	positive
The chemistry between Efa Iwara and Bisola Ayeola is so lovely, and when Efa switches to his comedic role is actually hilarious.	positive
its a good movie, see it.	positive
Best Nigerian Film Ever. . . . LionHeart works so well as Comedy/Drama without even trying.. The humour flows naturally and it showcases the Nigerian culture and values in the most beautiful ways. The picture is absolutely beautiful but the performances are even better. Great job Genevieve Nnaji. Thank you for making us proud.	positive
The most underrated and underappreciated work of art in human history.	positive
Set against the backdrop of the 1976 coup attempt in Nigeria this is a good movie. Not much shoot em up but good drama.	positive
A huge progress for Nollywood movies. . I really enjoyed this movie, the truth behind it, the thrilling plot. Really outstanding work!	positive
Great movie but weak ending. . . . The movie was great until the last 20 minutes, it's just went armateur. Was strong until they had to fill in too much details just before the end and then not even end the story.	positive
A must watch. . . . The movie was amazing, its a must watch. If you want to pass time quickly watch this. I love the taxi scene, it is my favourite.	positive
The locations are perfect for the movie, giving us such a rich viewing experience, moving us from the affluent neighbourhoods to the almost destitute areas where people have to work for daily wages.	positive
A new dawn in the Nigerian movie industry.. . . . It's very different from the average Nollywood movie, very entertaining and keeps you glued to your seat for the entire duration.	positive
The result is a work in which style and story unite to create a singularly mesmerizing look at a culture within a culture.	positive
I started the movie expecting it to be interestingly amateurish as have been some movies I have seen from that part of the world. But as the movie progressed, I realized it did not suffer in production values at all; in fact, it was superior in some ways to anything I have seen coming out of the West lately.	positive
Loved it. . . . It was funny and good acting. Very nice romantic comedy! It nice to see African movies and actors	positive
Great Piece. . . . This is a well-crafted, mind blowing work. The fact that I couldn't guess or know how it was going to end, blew my mind. The suspense is top notch. No unnecessary clip to prolong the movie but straight to the point. This is changing the narrative of Nollywood movies. Cheers to the Writer and Director. Highly recommended.	positive
The post script scene will have you laughing out of the cinema hall, and you will find yourself breaking out in a grin each time you recall flashes of the movie.	positive
Nice Movie. . . . Really had a good time watching, the cast and crew wereÃÅ excellent! Amazing storyline . Kudos to the actors, Directors and producer. Will definitely recommend.	positive
Great Movie about relationship with God. . . . I totally enjoyed watching this movie, it stirred up something in my spirit to be persistent with my walk with God and was a reminder that He is my father I can always talk to anytime. There is room for improvement for a better execution.	positive
"""the greatest inspirational movie I have seen so far. impresively directed and excellent performances"""	positive
It is lovely to see Kolade handle the car so well.  Daddy Showkey is the don and major bad guy, and he wears the role well. His acting needs some work, but he did not disappoint.	positive
Quite interesting Well Its about a Chicago gang star and one ex army general in Nigeria in the reverse. But all that is now gone as we know more.	positive
Funny. . . . Funny and good acting. A different cool vibes.. . . . I like how the main character is put of the ordinary and how the women stand up to the men.	positive
The storyline is unpredictable, the acting of most of the characters are believable. The picture quality is amazing!	positive
Fast-paced, funny, and sweet, The Royal Hibiscus Hotel proves that playing within genre doesn't have to result in a mediocre film	positive
If you are looking for a tight plot, excellent acting, unusual reveals, and situational comedy, with a touch of home-grown romance, this is the movie for you.	positive
Juju stories is a three short stories in a 1 hr 20 mins movie. The first story 'Love Portion' is where the juice is, the second story is 'Yam' is a woeful failure and 'Suffer The Witch' is eerily good. It is a win, 2 out of 3 were good.	positive
Great movie. . . . The movie makes you feel every emotion which is a great marker for a great movie. It made me laugh, cry and filled with suspense on what will happen next. The production of the movie is A1 and the cast did a great job in portraying their characters. I enjoyed every second of it.	positive
This story is no fiction. The doctor who saved her country (and probably the world) from a deadly outbreak of Ebola has died from it. This very moving movie retraces what happened in Lagos in July 2014 with force and simplicity. The actors are convincing, true... It's sad, obviously, but also enriching with hope.	positive
Under Rated. . . . Good cast, good storyline. It's as real as things seem in Africa. Good watch	positive
A  must watch. . . . I loved this film it was so funny & romantic Simply brilliant	positive
Funny Funny Funny. . . . Oh mehn, this movie is super funny. if you are looking for a movie to lift your mood up then this is the right movie for you.	positive
The locations add to the appeal of the movie The Lady Called Life and makes the movie relatable. It is beautifully and artfully done, and leaves a good feeling.	positive
I've never been this proud of a Nigerian movie and the fact that I'm seeing it the second time with this much excitement üòÉThis movie is beautifulüëå Story was a true Nigerian story, told the Nigerian way.	positive
Good to see a Nollywood movie that unites tribes and promote gender equality in an interesting way.	positive
"Quality is the hallmark of this movie. 'Lionheart' screams ""Quality! Quality! Quality!"" The production is a hundred. Everything just shinny and crispy."	positive
Great storyline, excellent audio and video quality. Production was top notch! Great combination of actors	positive
Great movie. . . . Upbeat with underlying messages on family, loyalty, hard work and female success.	positive
Great Film. . . . I hesitated viewing the film before reading the novel. After seeing the film, I am more intrigued about the novel and the history behind it. This is a GREAT FILM, make no mistake about it.	positive
Amazing production, impressive quality. . . . Once I started I couldn't stop, I even watched it over and I NEVER do that! Fantastic storyline, great characters and performances. The production is my highlight, you can tell the level of detail that was put into this brilliant movie. I'm very impressed! More please!	positive
pretty good movie, but it felt kinda long to me... but definately worth watching	positive
Great TV Show!. . Thoroughly enjoyed season 1, the storylines and plot are compelling and I like that how it also has a comedy side to it. Can't wait for season 2! Congrats to the cast!	positive
It is a well directed and produced movie with a very sensitive theme. The story is well told and brought to life with an amazing cast.	positive
A must watch for younger Nigerians and general lovers of a good film.. . I will be looking out for more work by Kunle Afolayan. Well done!!!	positive
The drama is fast-paced and well apportioned; the comedy is natural and connects well with the viewers.	positive
Breath of fresh air!. . . . FINALLY - a movie shot in Nigeria with international standards. Effortlessly funny and cunning, superior direction and cinematography. Eclectic, intentionally entertaining and attention gripping. Perfect blend of wit and humor depicted through deliberately complex yet simple visuals. Left me with the happy fuzzys.	positive
I love King of Boys. . Kemi Adetiba is a Brilliant Producer. King of Boys is a must watch. I love the drama and suspense.	positive
5-star movie alert!. . . . Citation is a must watch for everyone, it embodies a part of the rich African culture, an amazing love story, overall the movie is fantastic.	positive
Beautiful production but a weak storyline. . . . The acting was superb. Charley Boy is a delight to watch on camera. This was a wonderful effort by Kemi Adetiba and I'm really happy I got a chance to watch this.	positive
pretty good. . . . It felt semi messy at times and was very overdramatized but I really enjoyed watching it anyway	positive
Amazing work of art!. . . . Doctor Lanre will leave you glued to your seat all through. Great story, amazing cast, fantastic rendition of lines and suspense filled. The story is so unique, a diversion from the regular Nollywood love story.	positive
Outstanding. . Good acting performance to all the characters. Great videography. Truly epic & relatable to the street life of many. Perfect!!	positive
It is the kind of distinctive, culture-driven drama from emerging filmmakers that I wish we saw more of.	positive
Amazing show. . . . This show is super amazing. It has 13 episodes and i was able to finish all episodes in 2 days.. . . . Can't wait to see Season 2.. . . . Everyone did very well, it is hard to pick my favorite.	positive
I saw this film in the FIFF (festival de films internationnal de Fribourg, in Swiss). This story is beautiful, and Adewale Akinnuoye Agbaje is incredible. If you can see the movie, you must go, you wont be sad !	positive
I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Beautifully shot and delightfully funny.	positive
Very Touching, Very good, Very recommended	positive
If you enjoyed the Godfather then you'll enjoy this. The storyline was beautiful and the plot twist at the end was incredible but there was some very unrealistic scenes that prove to be plot holes. But all in all the plot is very solid.	positive
Amazing Film. . . . Indeed the most anticipated film from Nollywood 2019 didn't disappoint. Loved it all. Well done to Genevieve and Team	positive
The plot twist is different. Kudos. . . . I'm a fan of Nigerian films. This one is different. The plot twist is different that I couldn't predict nor see anything coming. Kudos to the writer Ifeanyi Opara. The actors were super too. Characters were well interpreted	positive
Dope movie. . The cast selection was perfect, costumes on point and made a good villain üëè	positive
"""Narradores de Jav√©"" is a funny and dramatic simple story supported by a good and original screenplay, great direction and excellent performances of the cast formed by actors, actresses and amateurish simple persons."	positive
Adewale Akinnuoye Agbaje and his life story touched my heart.. . . . Totally underrated.. . . . It's very well directed, and very emotional.. . . . I recommend this movie to everyone who likes biographical movies and real life stories.	positive
This world is ravishingly beautiful, but there‚Äôs also something oppressive about its exoticism. The color doesn‚Äôt just saturate the frame; it thickens it.	positive
This epic approach to a terrible conflict incorporates newsreels and maps to make things clearer for the uninitiated. It's an impressive film on many levels, and a significant achievement for the embryonic Nigerian film industry.	positive
This Lady Called Life is a gentle and sweet romantic comedy woven around the issues of childhood parental abuse and of generational curses.	positive
Beautiful, poetic, and hard-hitting without the use of excessive force and deeply layered with evolving and regional nuances of feminine experience	positive
A much needed mascarade. . . . This is not just another naija silly film. It's still silly and Nigerian, but in a witty, essentially thought-provoking way. It's a statement. An indepth look into physical vs spiritual balance, which we're all seeking today. A fable with humble esthetics.	positive
Good watch. . Nigerian Nollywood movie is on the next level, nice storyline..	positive
nollywood going up YEsSIR. this is a new bar set dude and i love that its written and directed by a woman	positive
Absolutely Splendid diving into a decade long issue of harassment by Lecturers. . Please more of this meaningful content. Not movies focused on Lekki and oil money lifestyles. Yes some things might have been better but it gets a 10 from me because this is the type of content i love to see come out of nollywood.. . . . Big respect to you Kunle.	positive
great cinematography. good editing. could do with a better story. writing was good also. overall good movie. great work by genevieve nnaji	positive
Very Different!. . . . This is not your everyday movie. The star actors really deserve awards for their roles. I loved every minute of it. Please watch!	positive
Loved everybit of this movie. . . . I have seen this movie 5 times already. i really like the movie	positive
Mind Blowing Piece Of Work.. . . . Enjoyed it. Been a while I saw a movie so well acted and delivered. The theme was beautifully touched on. Well done Genevieve Nnaji and Team. Looking forward to your next reviews	positive
Isoken is so beautiful üòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è. . Love the outfits. . The ending location was beautiful too, and I enjoyed the ending itself as well.. . . . I was feeling down and this film lifted me up üòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è	positive
Funny Christmas Comedy. . This movie had me cracking up from the start.	positive
Excellent and well portrayed series about the Nigerian Legal system. . . . Very informative about the Nigerian Legal System. It also portrays the challenges in family business and the compromises that follow.	positive
Carries a rare sense of pensive cognizance and further provokes reflection on the part of its target audience.	positive
I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone interested in Nigerian history and heritage.	positive
Juju stories is a three short stories in a 1 hr 20 mins movie. The first story 'Love Portion' is where the juice is, the second story is 'Yam' is a woeful failure and 'Suffer The Witch' is eerily good. It is a win, 2 out of 3 were good.	positive
a week in the life of nigerians. good stuff.	positive
We were blessed to see 'Coming From Insanity' with a thirty something strong audience and we could literally feel their veins bursting with excitement as we were drawn closer and closer to the climax.	positive
Enjoyable. . This movie is enjoyable. Just keep an open mind, It is nice to see how upcoming actors and musicians can hold their own.. . I binge-watched it.	positive
Beautiful movie depicting historic events in Benin kingdom. . Kudos to the cast and crew.	positive
EXCELLENT film! The actors were great performers. The scenery and backdrops were well done. The soundtrack outstanding. The storyline is the bomb!	positive
Audiences will be pleasantly entertained with Nigerian director Kemi Adetiba's The Wedding Party, a charming, romantic comedy with a unique international flavor.	positive
lol dis movie is funny √∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???√∞???	positive
This movie is one that captured and then diminished my interest,but then captured it again.	positive
Uplifting, inspirational, beautiful movie.. . . . My husband chose this movie and I didn't want to watch it. But I became totally sucked in and couldn't leave the room. The story of Sade is sad, but all that she goes through brings healing to her broken heart and changes her life in a meaningful and positive way. My husband and I both loved this movie!	positive
Interesting but.... . . . It was too much melodramatic, but I enjoyed it. On the other hand this is a great tribute to all the medical staff who where at the epicenter of the crisis.	positive
Greetings, the movie the figurine reminds me a lesson from the English text book read during or probably school days, namely The Bottle Imp. The crux of the movie plot/story is identical equal to the bottle imp. Please no controversies, just my opinion, that is all. . . Thanking you...	positive
This is an incredibly tasteful movie. Great acting by the leading lady.	positive
Kunle afolayan master piece	positive
The casting of KOB 2 gives the most appropriate roles to the people who would leave all on the screen, and they give stellar performances, including those who had non-speaking roles and cameo appearances. The acting is on point, so much that even facial expressions spoke volumes.	positive
Top notch. . All I have to say is that this movie was topnotch!!!! Kemi Adetiba you are the bossüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩ	positive
Best of Nollywood. . . . This is truly an exceptional film. the acting as beautiful and believable. Kudos to the team behind the film and Biola Alabi. Seyi Shay is a star abeg. And the camera WOW!!! Nollywood to the world!!!	positive
Citation: Kunle Afolayan's Deceptively Simple Yet Incredibly Complex Movie	positive
Excellent Storyline and Great Characters. . . . Can't wait for Season 2!!! The show is well written, the characters are fully developed and the story lines are complex.	positive
Absolutely brilliant. . . . Couldn't have been better really. I wondered what they would create after the initial movie but this limited series shows that a lot of work went into the production of this movie.	positive
Great work. . This was a good one, watched it once but it was totally worth it.	positive
The quality of the script cannot be faulted. It shows a well researched storyline that flows naturally and has no stilted parts. You would keep wondering, thinking you had solved the crime, only for you to later realise the script is several steps ahead of you. The movie is two and half hours in length, but there is no dull moment.	positive
Great film. . . . I worked on this film. I don't normally watch films I've worked on but this was amazing top man ade John	positive
Don't listen to this negative feedback. . . . I‚Äôve noticed some people can't handle the truth so they have to make up lies this is a great film not everything is true in the film but Adewale has said that but the old Tilbury skins are just jealous .... Take the film for what it is and understand life was bad in the 70s 80s for a lot of people enjoy the film and don't listen to this bad criticism.	positive
Was glued!!!!. . . . I enjoyed it. It was brilliant coming from the stables of Hollywood movies. Not a wasted time spent	positive
It's good if you enjoy the subject. . . . If this is a subject you like then it's a decent movie.. . . . But it is extremely subdued and slow. The movie makes it worse and often is as loud as the speaking.	positive
Outstanding- sad, painful and jubilant	positive
This is a must see movie. I was very impressed!!!	positive
NOT A FAN OF NIGERIAN MOVIES, BUT THIS ONE PLEASES. . . . The cast director selected wisely, the actors impressively reincarnate the true events back to life. Overall, its a cinematic masterpiece, hence the Netflix distribution.	positive
I'd say: worth watching!. . . . Well made, well played, good actors, even though it might seem a bit slow at times (and over 2 hrs altogether), I still think it is worth watching anytime. Of course, it is not the brightest and happiest movie to watch during these corona and pandemic times.... . . . but I liked it.	positive
I Enjoyed every bit of LionHeart. It warmed my heart watching Nollywood veterans bring the characters to life. Totally enjoyed Genevieve's acting.	positive
Powerful Movie asking and exposing the world medical system as satanic	positive
Absolutely Stunning Picture. . Incredible. . . The lighting, cinematography, props are so beautiful, this movie can definitely be categorized as modern classic.	positive
My own understanding. . . . The storyline is interesting and I loved everything about the movie üî•üî•	positive
Amazing. . . . The storyline is quiet interesting, the actors are amazing and it wasn't as predictable as I thought it would.. Picture quality is awesome, Molly wood has really grown.	positive
A must watch!. . . . From beginning to end, the hairs on the back of my neck couldn't stop standing. The story line was simple yet captivating, the acting was bang on and flawless.	positive
Well, the movie is good, I actually enjoyed it I got what I expected after seeing the end scene of Chief Daddy (the first movie) The actors did a good job with their roles, and yea the movie gat me laughing üòÇüòÇ It was hilarious.	positive
This movie is a beautiful representation of a modern life for a family faces with running a failing company in Nigeria, the camera play, acting and just overall environment of the movie exceeded its expectations. . . LOVED IT	positive
Good African Soap Opera. Two Thumbs Up	positive
I thought it would be quite boring, however it was more engaging than I supposed, good characters, good acting, marathoning Nigerian movies and in love with them... , by the elite population, sad observation, apart from the patriarchal machismo, the scene of the wife humiliating herself to apologize, on her knees, was outrageous, although it has a comical character, veiled submission, or explicit...	positive
Beautifully written!. . . . ThereÃÅ wereÃÅ no words minced and no truth, decorated falsely. This teaches a whole lot of message and exposure to the human trafficking world! Plus Sharon Ooja is such an exceptional actress.	positive
THE BEST MOVIE. EVER.. . . . Things Fall Apart is the BEST movie ever. Even better than The Force Awakens. It should have won at least 5 Oscars. Okonkwo is the sexiest man I've ever seen, and everyone I've met who have seen him desire him.	positive
Great documentary. . . . Spent the entire time looking at her beautiful skin( bev naya) and listening to the soothing soundtrack.	positive
Well written and superbly directed!. . . . Nigeria is really peculiar, from the demographics and its diversity, Doctor Lanre touches every part our realities and everyday living. Doctor Lanre is a must watch!	positive
One of the best in African drama series. . . . The talent, top notch , such quality acting from those ladies, hands down perfect.and the script was informative and well executed.. . . . Keep it up Nollywood you're on the right track.	positive
Petition for a season 2!. . . . I really really loved this and could totally relate, interesting from start to finish, kudos to cast and directors. Can there be a season and maybe better publicity?	positive
Loved the movie. . . . It had a slow start but quickly picked up! A must watch!	positive
Powerful and deeply human film. . This is a very beautiful and thought-provoking movie which I can highly recommend to everyone.	positive
Great Movie. . . . Kudos to the production team. Excellent Movie, The picture quality was Superb. Depiction of culture, through language, mannerisms etc was impeccable	positive
"""Narradores de Jav√©"", a generally hidden treasure even here in Brazil, is a very good Brazilian film with a simple, but good story."	positive
MY FAVORITE ROMCOM, YOU BITCHES COULD NEVER!!! and i was rooting for the white man... what about it? i can hate em and love em at the same time, the duality of man. thank you	positive
A great inspirational movie. A great family movie to watch with older kids.	positive
I loved this	positive
great movie, sending love from Naija	positive
Such wonderful writing. . . . Doctor Lanre is a wonderful movie. Had so much fun watching this one. It captures the everyday life, demographic, region, it is diverse and a joy to watch.	positive
Brilliant film. a really good watch	positive
Amazing. . . . This is a much watch movie , absolutely draws you in ,in this true story , please please watch this as you won't be disappointed	positive
Great ending. This movie kept me interested until the end, which is not easy to find in movies these days. A little predictable but still has suspense.	positive
Some very fine acting. . . . With all the fake drama dominating Nollywood, which nothing says about the life of average Nigerian, Mokalik almost feels revolutionary. Values are the thread of an only apparently simple story. Really wish this movie may set a bew trend	positive
Want to watch again. . This is one of those Nigerian movies you watch over and over and over again. Great work all through.	positive
Overall, it's a fascinating slice of modern history that may be unfamiliar to some, which can also give us an insight into the making of contemporary Nigeria.	positive
Original. . . . I am impressed. And I am rarely with 9ja movies/series. But am here at 1am watching this. It connects the dots. Kudos to the effort. Arese kudos.	positive
so cool. . . . This was so chilled. this movie was fun and enjoyable from the start. I've found no flaws to it, maybe the introduction is a little corny, but thats just taste. this movie was light but meaningful. highly recommended!	positive
KOB is Number 1 Nollywood movie to me right now. The story is way different and genuine. Unveils what goes on in politics for real.	positive
This was an excellent movie. I would recommend it to anyone!	positive
Love this Film. . I will enjoy watching it for many years to come and the conversations that it will spark. . . The acting is very natural without melodrama and it feels very believable. Overall, the film was riveting and kept me really engaged.	positive
Love this Film	positive
A BRILLIANT MOVIE WITH A FEW PECKS	positive
Beautiful story that portrays Nigerian culture. The story is so unique and unpredictable unlike an average Nigerian movie. A must watch	positive
A must see, very interesting story and well acted, great collaboration with Hollywood and Nollywood actors. I thoroughly enjoyed it.	positive
Fresh POV. . It is not the kind of cinema we are used to in the western hemisphere, but the production highlights not only a story to develop, but also the colors and culture of the region in which it takes place.	positive
"""Citation"" works best when it hovers in the infuriating skepticism hurled at its young protagonist as she makes her case, and it's unclear whether the system will work in her favor until the final, unnerving act."	positive
In a movie which seems like it should have been a mini-series, we follow a relationship, which grows into a family, over the course of 20 years in Nigeria.	positive
Finally, a good one. . . . A solid entry from the stables of Ayo Makun that combines genuine comedy with love at heart. A must watch for all Nigerians.	positive
The best Nigerian movie I've ever seen. . This movie is amazing! Very creative and not predictable. I love how the story line is current and relates to what is going on in Nigeria at the moment. The acting was great - Sola Sobowale is a legend!	positive
It's a superb piece of work: fresh, harrowing and very humane	positive
Good series. . I'm really impressed with this series. Its captivating and entertaining.	positive
I love this movie. . . . This movies is a very good movies and I wish it will still continue and please when is the season three and four going to be released .	positive
This is the reality of being a fault first child in affluent African homes.. . This movie is the reality of the struggle of being female in a male dominated and controlled African environment.	positive
Wonderful story. . . . The movie has a lot of moral lessons. Great role interpretation by Zainab Balogun. If you have lost your way, this movie all you need to re-direct your path to God.	positive
A provocative if slightly plodding movie‚Ä¶	positive
Technically, the sound is very good, and camera angles and techniques are unusual and interesting. The fight scenes are well choreographed.	positive
Best Nigerian movie seen in a long while. . Amazing movie that really l captures Nigerian culture and its movie industry	positive
What a disturbing but engaging story. . . . This is a really disturbing story. I feel so sad for Enitan, I cannot possibly imagine what he went through in his childhood. His transformation is remarkable. In the final ending it reveals who Enitan is, and I'm shocked by the revelation. It brings the film to another level of emotional climax.	positive
Incredible movie, great rendention and good story line.	positive
Romper Stomper with a twist and also a masterpiece drama. . . . Best Skinhead Cultural movie done in years...if you like movies like Romper Stomper, This is England, A Clockwork Orange...you will probably like this and if you like well made dramas also.... actors first movie produce and from peronal experience too....exellent work mate....loved it...so sad that people down grade this masterpiece in art form from a personal view, from a rookie of making movies... enjoy folks....	positive
Really great for women (and men too). . In a world where women are pressured to look better than they are, and live above their means, this show serves as a great tool of financial education to guide them into sensible organisation of their finances and the benefits of delayed gratification. Oh, and it's entertaining too! Fantastic acting!. . . . I don't know what's with the music production though, seems like the same songs were on repeat in every episode.	positive
The use of proverbs, innuendos, and play on words, provides so many memorable one liners and quotes that will remain on our tongues for a long time. We will quote the lines and recall the pleasure of watching this series.	positive
Good for a first.. . A fairly straightforward plot that delivers nothing new, save being the first Nigerian Christmas themed movie. The casting was sweet.	positive
A very good movie with a good lesson!. . . . This is movie is about a coming of age comedy/drama about a young boy who wants to fix things with his hands rather sit behind a cubicle. In a broader sense, I think this is just celebrating how things are done in Africa, and how kids learn to be humble.	positive
Citation delivers on giving us a logical representation of what happens in the real world to a large percentage of the youth, particularly students, and more particularly those of the female gender.	positive
Crazy,Lovely,Cool. . . . My favorite Nigerian actress Adesua Etomi-wellington brought me to this tv series and I was not disappointed, it was a pleasant surprise to see good acting, really good writing on top of seeing her, all main characters had substance and were not over the top clich√© characters, each episode could stand on it's own with plot twists and reveals, if anybody is looking for a good binge watch you couldn't go wrong with this Nigerian gem	positive
It‚Äôs a pity, because this could have been very interesting. But as it is, it's just total amateur hour.	positive
Was glued!!!!. . . . I enjoyed it. It was brilliant coming from the stables of Hollywood movies. Not a wasted time spent	positive
Phenomenal!! Proud of this Nollywood Production!!	positive
An Amazing Movie. . . . A beautiful story, well told & portrayed. Everything from the locations to makeup, cast, costume, even language & and the showcase of culture was simply breathtaking. Well done Kunle Afolayan	positive
Super Recommended! 'Gold Statue' is Magnificent Excellence. It promises a mountain of fun. And with that mountain, comes rivers of quality and an avalanche of Perfect acting performances. This movie is worth every penny you will spend and more.	positive
Hands down the best Nigerian movie I have ever seen..	positive
Good but Kinda Cheesy. . I liked this murder mystery from Nigeria. . . The plot was thick and readable part way in but far enough in to keep my interest.	positive
IntereÃÅsting. . . . This movie was intereÃÅsting from start to finsh. The acting was world class.	positive
What it means to be Nigerian.. . . . Well done Genevieve Nnaji: a movie for all to see. Kudos Naija, keep improving.	positive
Only one problem	positive
Lionheart is a solid film that effectively portrays sexism in workplace in Nigeria. It is very straightforward, highly predictable and also quite weakly directed by Genevieve Nnaji. But on the opposite side of things, her acting performance is terrific, and she successfully elevated both the character and the overall material. The movie is clich√©d, but charming. It would have been a perfect potential nominee for the Academy had they not stupidly eliminated it due to it being filmed in the English language.	positive
Mind blowing!!!!. . . . This is one of the best movies I have ever watched! I LOVE it!!!!!	positive
A wonderful film experience! Substantial storyline.. . The suspense would keep you on your toes, and the comic relief would make you chuckle. It is definitely worthwhile.	positive
A good sequel but a remake would have been far better for good story buildup. . . . I must say I commend the director and his acting too ( Ramsey Nouah).	positive
100% on point. So accurate n so well played. Everyone was fantastic. Makes one proud ure Nigerian üëèüëçüòò	positive
It is beautiful to see Sam Dede on our screens again, and to see he is still a master of his craft, giving us a stellar performance. Where there is Stella Damasus, you can be sure to see some genuine tears, with emotional scenes, and she seems ageless.	positive
Perfection. . . . This is a must watch movie!. I can't even say more. I'm short of words.	positive
Interesting how open the characters are to speaking about their relationships and with restraining anger during such emotional circumstances.	positive
It was pretty interesting to actually find out how the hymn Amazing Grace was actually written.	positive
This movie really touched my heart in regards to God's AMAZING GRACE! A MUST SEE!!!	positive
Not only does the plot fail to grip the viewer's attention, but the acting is the poorest, most unconvincing ever.	negative
This movie is long and dull. Even the background music is tepid. And there's nothing that can do to save the movie.	negative
A fine way to completely ruin your day	negative
unsettling	negative
The subjects in Swallow would make anyone cry -- poverty, sexual harassment, drug dealing, systemic corruption -- but the movie and all the characters are flat and emotionless.	negative
Though the central performance is impressively raw Farming's uncompromising bleakness drowns out the fascinating story, making it a far tougher watch than it needs to be.	negative
Story inconsistencies and the mystical balderdash were too appalling to be saved	negative
There wasn't a single person that wasn't insulting this as we trooped out. Even cinema staffers who didn't pay, were hissing. Horrible	negative
Equally powerful and uncomfortable, Farming is a stark reminder of the dangerous lengths that self-loathing can lead to.	negative
A terrible way to start the year; 'Akpe' is a mess.	negative
You might not hate yourself for seeing 'SuperStar' but you will leave feeling numb & comatose.	negative
It would definitely be unfair to the entire cast and crew if I left this one out. Totally unfair!	negative
Like other misguided projects like it, 'Knock Out Blessing' was made primarily for the purpose of massaging its producers' ego rather than pleasing its Nigerian audience.	negative
Akinnuoye-Agbaje's slightly numbed screenplay never gets to grips with who Eni is	negative
Fifty minutes is spent advertising a holiday resort in Lagos, Movie closes. Money down the drain. Not recommended	negative
Such a shame really; 'The Island' is a waste of amazing talent.	negative
if I said to you, that this was a spectacular movie, I would be telling a lie.	negative
Its lateness aside, the real problem with 'Funke' is that it is boring and unexciting.	negative
Not recommended! Crispy dry and terribly banal,	negative
Ultimately, this is a crappy offering that shouldn't have been brought to cinema.	negative
Production is fine, above average. Colour is sharp. And acting isn't horrific. The problem is the complete lack of intellectual strength in the story & the story-telling. A quick example will suffice:	negative
the amount of felonies this 6 year old committed over the course of this film became too many to count	negative
Suitable for 14 year olds. . Performed like a very clean Disney story. Limp and vacuous.	negative
There are some funny touches and moments of freewheeling energy, but it is too broad, with acting and directing styles that are a little like afternoon TV.	negative
Average. . The plot is just too short and predictable.	negative
But unfortunately, these shining moments were just to few and far between for them to justify paying serious money to see this	negative
moreover the drama between Joseph to his wife is played naturally but I feel like this is more documentry then a movie‚Ä¶	negative
Consequently, rhythms of long and short hisses echoed intermittently from the audience	negative
No one deserves to watch this shitty movie	negative
snooze fest, not much story, ridiculous soundtracks	negative
add horrible ADR, and average to really bad acting, and you have ‚Äî- a nightmare.	negative
It doesn't go wholly wrong all at once, but damned if the filmmakers don't lose the thread and stumble and lurch and pad this thing until their Nollywood film is Bollywood length, without the wit, warmth or content to justify it	negative
Grotesque and sub-standard. Boring and downright stupid!	negative
A flawed first feature film, but it shows a great deal of promise	negative
Concerning this popular movie #KOB I can't say it better or worst than the rest of nollyhood,	negative
Made in Heaven' is a stupid movie. It is so stupid, it will irritate you to the point you will start laughing out of sheer frustration. You will grow so weary seeing it, you will suddenly find yourself feeling as though you just might be enjoying the foolishness of this foolish movie. Very ridiculous movie. Complete rubbish!	negative
Slow moving, great acting and contains a few chills but the ending was unforgiving	negative
. In the absence of such a perfect storm, avoid stabbing your wallet in the heart with this 'Dagger'.. . Definitely not recommended	negative
When I say that the drive for comedy is turning our content to shit, this is a prime example.	negative
If  you watched Chief Daddy: Going For Broke on its New Year Day release on Netflix and immediately thought it to be a contender for the worst movie of the year, know that the fault isn't yours;	negative
Lazy and depressing!	negative
snooze fest, not much story, ridiculous soundtracks	negative
The movie wasn't great, a bit of overreaching of the actors (maybe over-directed?) but the context was great.	negative
Low quality for Such a High Budget	negative
A good plot. Terrible post-production.	negative
Not recommended.	negative
Great story, poor acting.	negative
A star studded movie that made stars look like they were acting a kindergarten play	negative
Not recommended.	negative
Preposterous! Horrendous! Disgraceful! A glowing shame.	negative
This movie's lineup makes me want to like it desperately, but it's difficult to relish amid the dim screenwriting by Genevieve Nnaji.	negative
By sure, one on the worst horror movies ever made...	negative
Talk about the acting though, the story script, it's something out of this world	negative
"Though falsely classified as ""Horror"", 'Bridal Shower' is in actual fact not a Horror-movie. It is a Stupid-movie- Completely and utterly stupid!"	negative
it is wholesomely pointless - A desperate money grab.	negative
Major Disappointment	negative
Boring	negative
Charming but incompetent	negative
Ruined by technical malfeasance, 'The Perfect Picture' proves to be miles away from being perfect.	negative
Slow moving predictability. . This film definitely belongs in the junior high circuit.	negative
but the sound and music was so bad that it destroyed anything good	negative
Did not watch all of this crap. Not even second rate, obviously racially inclined crap from an African nation with no film industry.	negative
Good storyline, poor execution	negative
The acting was bad, the soundtrack were repetitive, the storyline was... (if there was one I would have described it here).	negative
The plot it's good, but the technical aspects aren't that good at all.	negative
A clunky, clumsy handling of a book with (here untapped) depth	negative
There's nothing good about 'That Which Binds Us'. Absolutely nothing.	negative
Production of this movie is tight but the heart is missing	negative
Focused as it is on the relationship between Joseph and Suzy, the movie sheds little light on the February 13, 1976, assassination, which brought Olusegan Obasanjo to power.	negative
Utter rubbish! These are not serious people. Please, don't reward them with your Naira.	negative
this movie has to be the most depressing romantic comedy we have ever seen.	negative
Probably the worst acting ever in a movie which seems to be made with enough money.	negative
Way too slow. What a waste of time.	negative
I cant believe I spent 2 hours watching this movie	negative
i really don‚Äôt like this movie	negative
PLOT IS ALMOST EMPTY.	negative
Weak dialogue, amateurish battle scenes.	negative
From poor directing, to crap story; questionable acting to illogicality; shallow sceenwriting to bad editing..	negative
This movie is ugly.	negative
Asides from being terribly predictable and featuring generally below average acting, it is plagued by a be-fumbling series of subpar attempts at recreating worn out crime caper staples.	negative
I hate how this movie is titled.	negative
Bland and dreary, 'Efunsetan Aniwura' is an expos√© in gratuitously lazy and painfully appalling story-telling.	negative
I am livid	negative
THE LACK OF LANDSCAPE POSTERS FOR NOLLYWOOD FILMS	negative
ABSOLUTE RUBBISH	negative
this film promised so much but turned out to be gut wrenching ridiculous. Rubbish!!	negative
They seriously use smash bro‚Äôs title cards to introduce the characters...	negative
The movie seemed generally flat and draggy though out.	negative
It promised laughter, but the comedy was minimal and elicited smiles rather than the hearty laughter you expect when you go to the cinema for a comedy.	negative
Abigail isn't very good, the bad guy is a bit of a moustache twister, and they figured out that it sucks for black people to go back in time	negative
The lead female role a huge disappointment.	negative
The ending was the only enjoyable part of this for me. Good for her.	negative
"A travesty. . This is a disgrace and an awful disservice to CNA. Shame on this ""film""."	negative
A Trainwreck of a movie. 90s minutes of dissapointing Sound editing and acting.	negative
confused. . Was this what a good movie looked like in Africa in 2012? If so then ... it was great! I have to wonder (in that case) if it's gotten any better in 2021?.	negative
. Knock Out Blessing' is an utterly useless movie that ought not to have been made, or at least not released to the public. Rubbish!	negative
Unnecessarily long. . For me,	negative
for amateur actors that also had no direction from Akinropo. The sound was bad, probably from the lack of boom mics.	negative
Suga Suga has too many eye rolling scenes that eventually ended in an anticlimactic resolution of a weak conflict.	negative
Dishearteningly, Enitan's transition from lost soul to a scholar and now an artist gets shoved into the final minutes left over after all the bleakness.	negative
My first Nigerian movie. . . . For the past several years, I have come across a number of reports telling about how the country of Nigeria has a successful domestic film industry. While that fact definitely intrigued me, I was unable to find any Nigerian movies available for me to look at until I stumbled upon this one on Netflix. To be honest, I was expecting something pretty crudely made, and to a large degree this is true. While there are some pretty good composed shots and/or direction that indicate that at times some real effort was being made by the filmmakers, the movie has far more shortcomings. The cinematography is unimpressive, there's very little in the way of production values, and the acting by many of the performers is amateurish. Actually, I might have been able to forgive all that had the movie's biggest problem did not exist, that being that it's far too long (121 minutes in length) and far too slowly paced. This is a story that really needed to be cut down either at the script stage or when the footage was being edited. There is a twist towards the end that's a little interesting (despite my ability to somewhat predict it before it unfolded), but it's too little and too late to make it worth sitting through a story that's too long and too slow. Still, if you have heard of Nigerian cinema and are curious about experiencing a sample of it, I've just told you of one possible accessible choice.	negative
Unfortunately, we can't bear cowboy pistols, space guns, cut & sow costumes, annoyingly talentless filming and unnecessary long form remembrance ceremonies for already shown footage all buttered up with ridiculously unintelligent revelations of supposed-to-be shockers that were apparent from the beginning.	negative
Unfortunately, the film is often stately and sluggish with some very daytime-soapy moments of emotional revelation.	negative
The movie wasn't great, a bit of overreaching of the actors (maybe over-directed?) but the context was great.	negative
Once Upon A Night' is a dud.	negative
As it is, you get no sense of place or character because too much has to be glossed over to fit it all in.	negative
This movie is too boring for cinema.	negative
bad	negative
We call it a kidnap- Held hostage for fifty odd minutes, we were forced on an excursion of the resort grounds, Not recommended.	negative
This lion didn't have much of a roar. Did someone send their failed Netflix pilot script to Nigeria like it was the losing Super Bowl team's t-shirt?	negative
Forceful story-telling and embarrassingly bad acting are the hallmarks of this shabby pretender - Might sound weird but; this flick is like a counterfeit of 'Isoken'.	negative
Dumb movie. . This movie is a joke.	negative
Diabolically bad!. . This is realistically the worst movie I've ever seen in my life!	negative
Action sequences weren't bad and its heart was in the right place, but quite painful to watch in places.	negative
Though the cinematography looks professional, don't let this film fool you. It's a disaster.	negative
No head, no tail, bad script, absolute waste of time and expensive rubbish. Movie was such a pain to watch. I highly do not recommend.	negative
their star quality is lacking in this movie	negative
lolz	negative
Verdict: Not recommended. 'Charmed' is not charming.	negative
So disapppointed.. . Some acting moments from main actors (king and Amina), but the supporting actor (Maladi), hard to tell if he is comic relief because his role should be serious.	negative
Rubbish! Not recommended for anybody. Not even children. Very irritating movie.	negative
Hands down one of the worst movies I‚Äôve ever seen	negative
Worst remake. . There was poor directing at the beginning during Ahannas flashbacks when he witnessed a man being set ablaze.	negative
Rubbish. . . . One more piece of garbage from NETFLIX. Period !!	negative
Extremely flawed	negative
I skimmed this. no way i‚Äôm watching the whole thing	negative
you will regret wasting your time watching this movie	negative
Poor	negative
Excessively basic.	negative
The Millions' is essentially a shameless wholesale theft of 'Ocean's film series' scripts; we were not impressed.	negative
"Gbarada' is a typical Idumota ""Yoruba film"" with all the craziness that come with that sub-section of Nollywood."	negative
Holy one of Israel!. . What did Genevieve think she just did? A movie? This is corruption in the highest. The writers are quack.	negative
the worst movie production ever	negative
Just Crap	negative
Special Jollof' is yet another cold turkey from Nollywood in Diaspora. And as usual; it is highlighted by a y√©y√© story and a plethora of half hearted acting performances. There's nothing to see here. It's a total waste of money and time.	negative
I can confidently say that Luna taking a shit is a way more engaging story than chief daddy 2.	negative
i did not realise how many plane crashes there were in nigeria, and this film came out five days	negative
This Movie Would Have Done Better If Funded More ,	negative
With no modulating direction and no subtlety, this is a long, hard slog that will best be appreciated by friends and family of those in the cast and crew	negative
Not worth your time	negative
Utter rubbish. . It's very rare that I give up on a film, I couldn't finish this, gave up after 30mins. Don't waste your time.	negative
ultimately dampening the film overall for what could have been an even stronger, hard-hitting and poignant emotional roller coaster.	negative
Unfortunately lack of attention to detail didn't stop with the aforementioned examples.	negative
The Wait is full of stars, but it does not shine bright. It is like tasting a glass of wine that has not fully developed, perhaps, made with unripe grapes.	negative
This movie is so cheesy.	negative
this is an extremely boring and terrible film	negative
Hallmarked by nonsense, 'The Culprit' is complete and utter rubbish!	negative
Had to watch it for academic purposes.	negative
Way too slow. What a waste of time.	negative
Booorrring.	negative
That movie is such a bad egg to Nollywood.	negative
I caught the Nollywood bug while watching Rattlesnake.	negative
With all its ridiculous comical exaggerations and acting performances that fluctuate between over-acting and bad-acting.	negative
The production is all over the place, and most characters are not fully developed.	negative
waste of time and resources	negative
You will hate it	negative
Beautiful storyline BUT It was a waste of precious 2hrs	negative
Try as hard as they may; 'Your Excellency' proved extensively impotent, failing to deliver on its campaign promises.	negative
Absolute Garbage. . Not even worth being filmed. Actors are weak, script was written by a 12 year old. Poor sound quality.	negative
Taking a scenic, soap-opera route through the Nigerian civil war of the 1960s turns out to be a navigational error from which this lavishly appointed production can never fully recover.	negative
Continuity was not properly done for some of the scenes.	negative
The Final List' is a concoction of relentless hogwash.	negative
Completely whack and yet everything was so funny. Super entertaining, what else is there.	negative
I never feel sorry for the male leads in movies like this. Honestly, Team Sylvia. Dude was playing games.	negative
One of the things that may redeem an awful movie is costuming.	negative
Depressingly Boring and Pointless. . At the end, the movie fails in every way.	negative
"""The real Housewives of Lagos high society"" is wack"	negative
Awful. . The most stupid and dumb storyline in Nigerian movies history.	negative
Avoid this chunk of crap by all means necessary.	negative
Bland. Mechanical. Tactless. Frankly speaking.	negative
Lionheart does not really do or say anything new.	negative
Mofe ni Mofe' is a typical Yoruba movie made for African Magic Yoruba or even more appropriately; YouTube. It has no business in cinema.	negative
The movie tried to use suspense to depict some of the issues, but they were not properly executed.	negative
Appalling. A Nollywood soap opera plot that weirdly also foregrounds born-again Christianity	negative
Oldest skinheads in town. . . . Absurd plot which pretends to be based on reality.	negative
Despite its laudable intentions and important social message, Black November is far too ineffective to have the desired impact.	negative
"Just as the saying goes: ""All that glitters is not Gold"", 'The Bling Lagosians' is not Gold."	negative
Lazy. Distasteful. Unimaginative. A dire mishap. And a record setter.	negative
Bridal Shower' has the singular honour of corralling the worst actresses in contemporary Nollywood in one movie.	negative
Oh geezzzzzz. . . . What did I just watch for almost 30 mins? I tried and tried and tried to give it time but it was just awful! How did ANYONE think this movie was worth production??	negative
Menn! It was horrible joor!	negative
Worst ever movie- future cult classic?!. . Just dreadful, awful, trash....why on earth was this ever made?!	negative
Oh Dear!. . What a mess.But we've seen the whole fatal affair thing so many times and Deranged brings nothing new to the table.	negative
Debilitated by a weak story-line and even weaker story-telling, 'Mai'Muna' is a pedestrian 'drama that is not worth your time.	negative
W h a t. . . . Messed up and kind of all over the place plot	negative
Good movie, way too long. Storytelling also needs pace.	negative
Highly flawed	negative
Wow how dissappointed. . Awful stick with This is England	negative
Purporting to tell historical heroic stories of sacrifice and resolve against oppressive colonialism, '1929' is so terrible.	negative
its lack of subtlety blunts the film's force.	negative
Absolutely not recommended. This is hogwash!	negative
I hate it	negative
With Nollywood's Shortcomings, Let's Dissect the Story	negative
I feel like these guys have an incredible passion for filmmaking. That's good. Keep improving.	negative
I'm sorry, I just didn't like it.. . . . This film is a great example of some incredible archive footage ruined by a boring, mediocre and incoherent film in between.. . . . Yes, I have read the book. I wasn't expecting a literal screen translation of the book, as the book covers a vast array of characters, but I did expect the essence of it to be retained.. . . . It wasn't.. . . . The film follows the lives of twin sisters Olanna (Thandie Newton) and Kainene (Akina Noni Rose) right after Nigeria gets its independence from the British and through to the Biafran war, as the Igbo people struggle to establish an independent republic. The film (similar to the book) tries to follow the lives of these 2 affluent young women, their relationships with men and with one another set against a significant historical event in Nigeria.. . . . I went to watch this film specifically to support African Cinema and exited about a Nigerian Director making a film with a strong cast. I was bitterly disappointed with the lazy result.. . . . Firstly the performances; Chiwetel Ejiofor is ever earnest in his role as Olanna's lover Odenigbo. He is OK, not offensive and gives a similar performance as he did in 12 years a slave. Thandie Newton is horrific. She has literally two expressions. I like to think its to do with the bad direction, someone should have told her she's over-acting .. . . . The worst and best performance came from Odenigbo's Mother played by Onyeka Onwenu. What can I say. The best is that she was very entertaining, funny and a joy to watch. What made it the worst was that it belonged to a different film. A film I would have preferred to watch by the way. Her performance added a quality of a soap opera to the film. Anika had the strongest performance among them and deserves a mention for it. . . . . The film has two parts, the first comes across as a cheap soap opera and the second, a cheap action movie. Choices that were made baffled me. Scenes played out that were pointless and didn't add much to the plot, making the first half plod along longer than it should have. The second half was riddled with inconsistencies and poor editing. Characters were introduced just as quickly as they were killed off. I am not sure why it was important to illustrate on a map were everyone was, that added nothing.. . . . But the biggest problem with the film is that it lacked a director, a proper director. There wasn't anyone keeping the actors believable, controlling the movement of the camera, having a coherent edit or keeping tabs on the horrendous sound score.. . . . Unbelievably the producers also produced Constant Gardener and should have known better than this. How can you allow an inexperienced Director to helm such a significant film? It's arrogant and irresponsible.. . . . I am African (yes, I know it's a continent), I applaud any one trying to make our stories for an audience outside of the continent but this effort was so poor that I had to write about it. We can do much better than this.	negative
Absolutely Not Recommended. 'Detour' is completely asinine.	negative
Bad acting...	negative
The first major problem with this movie would have to be our lead actor. The other thing is actual performance.	negative
Sista Sista' is yet another colossal waste of money starring Enyimma Nwigwe, making it two crappy movies.	negative
A baseless movie	negative
However, in my opinion this is not Netflix worthy.	negative
Not recommended for intelligent minds.	negative
Transitions in the movie are haphazard and staccato.	negative
An ambitious film worthy of attention, regrettably it doesn't come together quite as powerfully as you'd hope.	negative
The Final List' is a concoction of relentless hogwash.	negative
The story is uninspired and adds nothing to the art genre it attempts to represent.	negative
This film is well intended and tries to go in depth on the issue, but sadly the filmmaking is so incompetent that it takes any emotional impact away.	negative
Not so here. 'Ajibade' is a typical Yoruba film with no real talent behind it	negative
Good sort, badly did	negative
I had hope for this in the begining, but it quickly faded away.	negative
This was bad in so many ways..	negative
Honestly, these people bamboozled us.	negative
The movie is barely giving what they think it is giving.	negative
"""New Money"" is a no no"	negative
The movie is overrated and wasn't what I expected at all	negative
This movie is a complete mess.	negative
. 'Big Fat Lie' isn't just not funny, it is terribly sub-standard too.	negative
Rant Queens' is reckless with stupidity.	negative
The movie was quite painful to watch and seemed to have been created mainly to shake the viewers with shock factors.	negative
Amateurish. Silly. Absurd. Ludicrous!	negative
A very boring film with poor acting	negative
Horrible! Oh my God! The ratings should even be a negative because I just couldn't believe the utter crap they produced!	negative
What a waste of time! Star studded casts with no story to tell. Zero sense of direction nor any reasonable theme....too much distraction from the family theme of part one....üôÑ	negative
It is not recommended because; despite what is admittedly very crispy production, ultimately. . characters obviously acting retarded through a series of nonsensical scenarios.	negative
Unfortunately it turned out to be a rain of illogicalities buffeted by amateurish acting	negative
Interesting premise, terrible script	negative
This movie deserves the award for the 1st disaster recorded in 2022. To those not familiar with Nollywood, this movie is not acceptable while those familiar with Nollywood understands this was terrible.	negative
The Ghost and the Tout' was let down by slack story telling, excessive over-acting and all round lacklustre performances.	negative
Nollywood as its worst	negative
terrible acting and production	negative
Impressive but not so Captivating nor Thrilling	negative
watching this movie is as bad as eating spoilt beans	negative
Horrible storytelling	negative
An uneven blend of melodrama and the horrors of civil war	negative
Unwatchable	negative
a clear lack of confidence in their own creative vision that the film's narrative must be meta and ironic in some sense.	negative
Paying to see it is tantamount to buying frustration.	negative
Contrary to its title, ‚ÄúSuga Suga‚Äù leaves more sourness and staleness in the mouth than sweetness.	negative
Underwhelming and bland;	negative
I will not try to say mistakes This is a childish production elementary school level.	negative
Are your people completely innocent in this 'exploitation'?	negative
Slow-moving Nigerian drama about sexual harassment, assault	negative
There is very little about this movie that makes sense.	negative
The cinematography in the movie was basic and was not too exciting.	negative
not good enough	negative
Maybe the best thing about this is that it's at least entertaining enough that you won't tear your hair out if you happen to see it	negative
The story is so convoluted and so unnecessarily dragged out that.	negative
Very disappointing adaptation of great novel Half of a Yellow Sun	negative
The movie is terrible to say the least, despite the top notch actors.	negative
Guynman' is special. It is specially stupid.	negative
Great story....AWFUL acting	negative
The entire production is very amateurish, the audio being the worst offender	negative
Repetitive and dull, 'Kasala' is the ultimate waste of money, energy and time.	negative
OVER-RATED, NO DIRECTION!!	negative
Mildy recommended. Started well but it fizzed out as it runs too long for its own good.	negative
Awful and terrible film,. . . . It's the worst film I've ever seen, the acting is so hammy,	negative
A dulled out audience, sleeping and snoring.	negative
There's too little value here to be worth paying premium for.	negative
Hogwash! Seeing this movie was such a pain.	negative
I did not what I watched.	negative
RHH Review	negative
What we got was a tacky ending with unrealistic dialogue.	negative
The music and audio effects did not always match the seriousness of some of the movie scenes.	negative
Farming is a great story ultimately defeated by its own unrelenting boorishness.	negative
the storyline did not slap, neither did the comedy stick.	negative
This movie is a no from me	negative
bad acting, stiff dialogue, and an overuse of a melodramatic soundtrack	negative
Poorly subtitled. . . . The language being spoken is Igbo but it is being labelled as Hausa.	negative
Surely, there are more tasteful and artistic ways to place products in a movie, without actually overwhelming the patrons.	negative
WTF. . . . BORING! I was so exhausted watching this movie. This movie has been before	negative
Terrible Movie... worst Nigerian movie I've seen	negative
Extremely Boring!	negative
new drinking game: take a shot every time you see characters wearing atrocious wigs.	negative
what is this????	negative
A waste of money. This movie is completely useless. It is crappy, dull and uninspiring.	negative
The movie was well done but I could not figure out what type of movie it wanted to be and what was the story about until I stopped watching somewhere at the middle.	negative
Despite strong performances and plenty of incident, writer and director Biyi Bandele fails to establish the narrative's wider national and political context, and the film is ultimately insubstantial as a result.	negative
Boring and weak plot.	negative
Good sort, badly did. . I was unimpressed due to the production of this both in terms of acting and script	negative
Possibly one of the worst films I've ever seen.	negative
their comedic antics have become too stale, too repetitive and too predictable to be worth recommending this sham of a movie.	negative
Profoundly irritating and annoying.	negative
It's your typical Nollywood movie, cheating, ancestral folklore, bad acting	negative
Then worst of all is the story; as simplistic as a Yoruba film story could ever be it lacks, intrigue, suspense or any telltale signs of intellectual manipulation.	negative
A grimly interesting story that is sadly reduced to a cliched, tedious movie.	negative
It‚Äôs odd that an autobiographical passion project feels so limp, hackneyed, and labored	negative
We can do better than this trashy movie	negative
For a supernatural thriller cum action movie, Nneka the Pretty Serpent took too long to make it‚Äôs point.	negative
What the hell is going on here. . The movie is so bad at some point you wonder whether you're watching a comedy or a drama movie.	negative
The movie has the most ridiculous robbery scene ever in the movie universe, and it is way too long.	negative
Poor visuals	negative
The worst part is that; for some uncanny reason, the producers chose to belabor their poor audience with unwieldy subtitles that disappear very quickly.	negative
Again, producer missed the point. . The movie has no destination, no solid plot, just run offs	negative
The Road to Yesterday is not, probably, the stupidest picture we ever saw, but it is, nevertheless, very, very dull, and well-nigh unintelligible as well.	negative
Suru l' ere' is crappy.	negative
An ecample of a character who does not fit the role in this movie is Tope Tedela. In his role as a semi-literate mai-suya, he is too refined and too well spoken. 	negative
not recommended	negative
This movie is bullshit	negative
As a comedy it starts out well enough but soon gets a little (but not much) more drama-like with its storyline to the detriment of the film. Has a very inner-city urban styling.	negative
I am angry I watched this movie	negative
This is a soulless muddled mess that does great disservice to a great book.	negative
As ridiculous and as unimaginative as its title is, very little separates 'Makate Must Sell' from Papa Ajasco's 'Knock Out'.	negative
This one star is for Oc Ukeje	negative
Good history, poor quality.	negative
Its characters (especially Sades) are messy and have many poorly executed emotions and phases of grief or happiness.	negative
Made for tv melodrama. . It was so cheesy at certain parts that it was hard to continue watching. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.	negative
you do not deserve to watch this horrible subpar movie	negative
MESSED UP MOVIE. . No lesson learnt. Please we don't want part2.	negative
Horribly Booring. . . . Wasted 2h20min of my life watching this baseless, senseless movie.. . . . Its seriously bad!!!!	negative
Terribly made and stupidly written. This reeks of the Hallmark Channel.	negative
Not bad, not good, just unmemorable.	negative
Slow moving predictability	negative
Had potential, but fails to draw you in	negative
It could've been way better.	negative
save yourself from this distateful movie	negative
Such a shame with 'Fantastic Numbers'; going by its sophisticated posters alone	negative
Poor	negative
Slow. . The acting is ok, but the script is quite poor.	negative
Limitlessly not recommended. Work hard to avoid this rubbish forever; even on TV.	negative
When we thought it was all over, the concluding scene brought even more confusion.	negative
Terrible and amateur attempt at a film . . Seems like someone's school project more than a real film . Terrible acting and production value .	negative
Scenes were muddled up	negative
This is four movies in one loosely bound by coke product placement	negative
Utterly not recommended. 'My London Slave' is complete hogwash. A total waste of money. There's no way you go in to see this and come out happy. Because, everything about this sham of a movie is calculated to irritate you. And it will. Please, don't pay for misery.	negative
Real life vs. badly executed. . bad acting, especially from the villains in this movie.	negative
The sketchy storyline is overly reliant on clich, caricature and contrivance.	negative
Alakada Reloaded' is a sham.	negative
DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE	negative
This is indeed a very stupid movie.	negative
I don't know man, this movie sucks and my legs hurt.	negative
Absolutely Not Recommended.	negative
The first notable flaw is the film‚Äôs length	negative
Well, when the main positive thing that people list about the film is the colour grading, you probably know you‚Äôre not going to experience an amazing story.	negative
Ultimately, it lacks any real story and as far as production is concerned.	negative
A good story ruined by a bad screenplay	negative
A powerful novel has been neutered.	negative
Would‚Äôve loved this if it starred Princess Vitarah.	negative
Such a shame!	negative
Only in broad Nollywood comedy mode does it feel truly convincing.	negative
Unoriginal and boring movie	negative
mean-spirited, unfunny, kinda classist.	negative
this movie is terribly boring. Very dull.Very draggy.	negative
It is a neccesity to remove this movie from being accessible to the media as it depicts and reinforces the great issues in today's modern society relating to racism.	negative
The Ghost and the Tout' is unrepentantly immoderate in everything.	negative
it is a good for nothing film that shouldn't have been made.	negative
what the hell is this that I watched	negative
Amateurish Production. . Started to watch this but it was so disjointed, jumping all over the place that I stopped after 20 minutes.	negative
Bitterly disappointing	negative
It is so very tonally deaf to what is going on	negative
Absolute Trash. 1985 Bollywood called, they want their script back.	negative
Lopsided. Low quality. Lackluster. And ludicrous.	negative
It was perhaps too close to the subject to tell it with the clarity it demands.	negative
The acting was great but the plot was quite weak.	negative
Watching this movie made me dull	negative
Dreadful. . I am baffled that Netflix would subject its audience to this kind of low budget rubbish.	negative
Has the look and feel of a soap opera from 1985 except with fewer twists, less campiness, no surprises, less suspense and a very long, drawn out plot.	negative
Social Media 101' is lazily unoriginal. This is the handiwork of an ideas pirate; someone who plagiarizes the creative ideas of others, makes them his own and seeks to profit from same. Plagiarism! That is the stuff 'Social Media 101' is made of. The producers put not an iota of creativity into making this a movie.	negative
The historical context is more intriguing than the specifics of this harrowing and provocative story, which lacks sufficient character depthand narrative texture.	negative
Waste of time. . Something to interest me or hook me...nothing what a Snoozefest!!	negative
DULL STORYLINE. . One of the worst Nigerian movies I have watched in a while.	negative
Awkward to watch	negative
almost felt like 2 different movies. The story needed tighter translation of the events happening.	negative
Opportunity lost	negative
NOT A MOVIE	negative
Psychological Horror, Nollywood Style!!! meddlecore14 October 2017	negative
So this was long and boring	negative
the chances of Nollywood making a great film is pretty slim.	negative
The need to be extraneously goofy and ridiculous in Nollywood cinema is getting annoying	negative
Can't say this movie makes sense	negative
Really awkward.	negative
so bad	negative
And underlining all that is a thick sludge of brazenly obvious & forceful comedy.	negative
.Although the tension is not too high, suspense is not a thing, the obstacle could have taken more sweat and sacrifices, but yet, Lionheart is really good.	negative
Another waste of time. . More Netflix boring crap, I'm glad it's free so i don't pay for these terrible selection.	negative
Ultimately, murdered by severe cases of over-acting and wanton fake-ness, 'Hire a Woman' is a sterile movie that lacks any real magic.	negative
Soap opera. . This is a bad soap opera pretending to be an air flight disaster thriller.	negative
Clustered Colours' is like cheap doughnut with plenty of nothing around a very tiny something.	negative
What happened to attention to detail	negative
This movie based on the ebola outbreak in Nigeria was very depressing and it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. In fact, it wasn't what I was expecting either.	negative
You should not watch this movie	negative
Production and soundtrack ruined a good story	negative
"Painfully slow and pedestrian horror soap opera whose only novelty is ""It's from Nigeria!"""	negative
And yet another forceful comedy. Nollywood just doesn't get it.	negative
Clustered Colours' is like cheap doughnut with plenty of nothing around a very tiny something	negative
Did not watch all of this crap. Not even second rate, obviously racially inclined crap from an African nation.	negative
There was nothing good about this movie	negative
The storyline is shoddy and has misplaced and unfunny jokes.	negative
This movie at best had mediocre acting, and tried to promote forgiveness for a highly abusive husband, rapist, and a pedophile of his adopted daughter.	negative
Hence, this wreck of a movie plays like a relic straight out of the nineties. A complete waste of money.	negative
Now, causing cinema patrons to sleep off their premiums isn't necessarily a crime in all cases.	negative
there's an unmeasurable deluge of nonsensical characteristics dogging this 'Good' movie.	negative
Good message, poorly executed	negative
some of the drama felt artificial made just to make two characters have some conflict, the characters were fine some were annoying	negative
A Hollywood Deception	negative
Good story spoiled by amateurs	negative
chief Daddy 2 is an unfocused mess, which would be tolerable if it only made us laugh more often.	negative
OMG Cringe. . . . What the actual F. The dialogue, the acting, the soundtrack	negative
"Painfully slow and pedestrian horror soap opera whose only novelty is ""It's from Nigeria!"""	negative
A sore disappointment. It is excruciating to sit through. Sob!	negative
A case of laudable ambition collapsed into episodic box-ticking.	negative
However, this failed to be anything other than boring. It had no logical flow	negative
Very bad acting, but the movie is still entertaining.	negative
This was a No, No! Really bad performances from the main cast.	negative
Entertaining despite being flawed	negative
This movie feels like a mish mash of under-developed ideas with a half hearted romance thrown in.	negative
The movie script cannot pass for a high school amateur production.	negative
I dislike this movie so much	negative
The acting was SO bad and the  writing was even worse.	negative
The acting is at best wooden, the dialogue almost staccato, as if the actors are constantly being prompted with their lines.	negative
Everything about this movie speaks low budget	negative
Dig to stole your time!	negative
What a Mess	negative
Only in broad Nollywood comedy mode does it feel truly convincing.	negative
Charmed' is not charming. No how!	negative
Horrible. . The show lingers on and on seeming to go no where at times.	negative
The fact that it's a musical makes it absolutely TERRIBLE.	negative
Utter fiction. The acting is awful and the story unbelievable.	negative
LMAO	negative
A sore disappointment, 'Levi' is drama without purpose.	negative
"The film is remarkable for its lack of self-pity, but it makes the experience of ""Farming"" a merciless one for the audience too."	negative
I am convinced it would have fared better as a 10 to 30 minute short movie to test the waters.	negative
drama without purpose.	negative
Well intentioned but amateurish attempt to move the viewer.	negative
Imagine trying to make indomie without spice. . This movie is soo bad that 5 minutes to the end you're still wondering what's going o.	negative
The screenplay is ridiculous	negative
They just sewed together different jokes, memes and videos of little known comics that have gone viral on Nigerian social media, called it their own movie and brought it to cinema. If you are Big on social media, you will have seen many of them, many times before. And you are not likely to find them to be very funny here as the producers even fail to excel at plagiarism, leaving 'Social Media 101' plagued by bottom of the barrel acting, very boring dialogue and particularly horrible scene lighting. This is all round ridiculous!	negative
"This movie is ugly. ""Ugly"" must be the word."	negative
Another Nigerian Movie With Lot of Hype but Very Empty.. . I won't recommend this to anyone.	negative
It's not really that bad - but the script and directing suffers overall.	negative
The movie‚Äôs opening is jarring. There is no backstory for Laila‚Äôs appearance	negative
Very poor story telling... and a massive rewrite of history for the sake of the movies plot.	negative
Retarded. Gratuitous. And senseless.	negative
Not a great movie	negative
This movie was an eyesore	negative
it tells a piecemeal story one could swear was hurriedly written by a primary school pupil for last year's Cultural Day drama presentation	negative
If you value your time, work hard to dodge this at a premium.	negative
Can a movie be bad, but important?	negative
If I were a film prof trying to get away with torturing my students, I truly cannot think of a better fit for a required screening.	negative
Too long, bad acting, too much irrelevance	negative
. Forceful story-telling and embarrassingly bad acting are the hallmarks of this shabby pretender.	negative
How does a movie with this subject matter wind up being this slow and boring?	negative
this is a story that has the potential for critical acclaim, but the execution is poor and makes it easily forgettable.	negative
This movie has less charisma than the 'Third Eye' series from the nineties with Pa Olu Jacobs. Stay away from this.	negative
nollywood keeps disgracing us	negative
Survival of Jelili' is a pageantry of the absurd and a flagrant eyesore.	negative
At the conclusion of the original Chief Daddy movie, the introduction of a new character in the last scene hinted at a sequel, but Chief Daddy 2 takes the sophomore curse to a new level of low.	negative
Wasn't supposed to end there.. unprofessional screenwriter	negative
The plot was totally unrealistic and it was all over the place.	negative
A colossal waste of time and money	negative
this movie is so lame, even children will not like it.	negative
"Absolutely Not Recommended. Filmmaking is not agbero work. Yet curiously, Nollywood financiers keep financing quacks, pretend filmmakers. Do they not know that ""making film"" is encapsulated in talent? You either have it or you don't‚ÄîYou can't fake it till you make it. Without talent, connections shall never translate to great films. They will always result in what we witnessed today: A discordant rhythm of harsh hisses from dissatisfied customers, their faces swollen with regret. Sad."	negative
Despite having what could have been a good story, 'Ile Owo' joins the infamous choir of yucky movies trespassing cinema. Having a good story is necessary but it is not enough. When you combine your good story with harrowing story-telling & mental laziness, the outcome can't even be classified a respectable horror movie. What you have, is a sham: Terrible casting. Cussed costuming. Irritating makeup. Lopsided acting. Kindergarten graphics. And puke provoking props.	negative
"Absolutely Not Recommended. Acting is quite good. Subtitling too. But that's where ""good"" stops in 'Yahoo Plus'. Everything else is rubbish."	negative
Story is stale & predictable. Story-telling is weak & impotent. Cinematography is so 1980s. And worst of all; picture quality is terrible. Looks like it was shot with Nokia3310.	negative
Avoid this. Don't be their maga.	negative
Tiger Tail' is an eye roller, a tummy churner & a head acher. It may cause you high blood pressure.	negative
It's amazing how good heads can come together to make bad rubbish. And the more expensive the head, the more terrible the performance. Appalling.	negative
"Acting is pretty good but story is ordinary & super predictable. And its comedy is crusty, mouldy & stale; mainly delivered by repeating now too familiar expressions like ""I dey your back like eczema"" & ""If I woze you, your brain go reset."" Yuck! Just too damn amateurish. Some people laughed shaaa. Regardless, by our own measure, there's too little value for money here."	negative
Sadly, 'Man For The Job' is an amalgamation of a good idea & interesting vision with inadequate talent & lack of requisite skill. Like building a Tesla in Aba, they tell a tech-story with Idumota story-telling. The end result is confusion.	negative
The main thing that attracted me to Ile Owo was the picture of Bisola Ayeola, on the movie poster, playing the role of an old witch, only for me to go see the movie, and she appears only in the last scene showing for less than 60 seconds. It was a great disappointment, but it was the culminating disappointment. You see, the whole movie makes me want to collect my money back, with interest.	negative
The movie spends too much time focusing on the horror element, and forgets to give us a proper story. It leaves too many questions unanswered, and not in a good way. The female lead is either over acting or under acting. Her screen chemistry with the other actors is almost non-existent.	negative
The audio of the movie is too loud, and focuses too much on the ominous element. There is not a single enjoyable score in the entire flick. Facial expressions are made baselessly, and we are left guessing what they mean. We never get the meanings, if they have any. Characters show up with no background, and no eventual explanation of their roles in the movie. Eventually, the ending leaves you wondering what you have just experienced.	negative
As much as we want Nollywood to explore more genres, this particular foray into the horror genre leaves a bad taste in the mouth. It is tepid horror, and has no tasteful story to compensate. The story synopsis has more meat in it than the actual movie.	negative
Tried hard to watch this, but it is absolutely terrible. The outline is OK, but the dialogue is awful and stilted and many of the actors struggle delivering it. Much of what occurs in episode one lacks any semblance of credibility.	negative
It made my eyes bleed to watch and is definitely not worth investing more time to endure further suffering.	negative
If you're a fan of crime thriller movies, this movie might slightly interest you. Slightly because they'll be no moment that'll keep you on the edge of your seat-and a couple of scenes are cringeworthy. The plot is infuriatingly weak considering the stellar cast and great acting on display.. . . . There's lots of positive with this series though and you're bound to still appreciate some moments in it. Big kudos to the production cast as the cinematography is one of the best I've seen in recent Nollywood productions.	negative
Storyline so weak from episode one to four.... the only I repeat good thing about the series is the camera and show of affluent and the negative part of the Nigeria society. If Mo Amodu had employed the patronage of critics before doing the final editing they could have product a beautiful and believable story to promote the beauty of Nigeria and not continual telling of how backward our society is...... am so disappointed at the level of creativity at her disposal her movies shows money but lack proper content.	negative
There are some errors in the story and acting but overall it's a good one	negative
Let's start with the negative First if all the acting of the main actress was mid, and how did the assassin get past the security with weapons and the unarmed ex couldn't, and as for the FJ role I believe there are better child actors, mad again How was the hotel completely empty of guests when the body was being transported, they had reservatioms right? There wasn't enough Then the positive If not for the above stated the casting would have been spot on.	negative
Totally unbelievable and absolute rubbish. Waste of a stellar cast. Just had to review to warn others not to waste their time. Go watch paint dry instead.	negative
Unbelievable. I do not know what's worse. The plot, the lack of good taste, the lack of logic. Nails, wigs and grotesque dresses. It appears that Nigeria's ruling class has a total lack of common sense. And to complete a half ending. As I said, horror show.	negative
The movie had good first 2 episodes but the twist at the last episode was lame . Then the so called chicago detective had to support d girls at the end which was a wash cuz clearly its not self defense anymore if you had to chop off a head and bury the victim . The writer lacked a good ending and it ruined the wonderful acting of the characters . Also ramsey noah role was quite poor and the concept of the vintage car was drooling. Why use such a slow car for such mission . They had to drag the whole timeline just for a bloody annoying chase .. In a real world , the girls wont survive these . The script is biased.	negative
Weak Storyline, script is awful. A detective wearing a small hat üëí with a toothpick in his mouth is so cliche. Feels like you are watching a bad 1970s police drama ü§î.	negative
ending twist was lame	negative
It was so awful it becomes brilliant.	negative
Starting from the idiotic assassin who was acting as if he was there to fight a professional wrestling championship, to the idea that the groom would be so calm after surviving a hit that he would retain on him the gun he dispossessed the assassin of, the movie was just stupid. The only thing for it was that the cinematics were quite good. Story was foolish, acting was ok, ending was asinine. But do also waste your data and time watching it. What a silly movie!	negative
This show was horrible. The plot, the sound, makeup, wigs, wardrobe absolutely horrible. I couldn't recommend this to my enemies. It's sad 'cause I grew up watching nollywood films, hope they get it together.	negative
. . I get that Netflix is trying to promote work from different countries, and I applaud the effort. There are plenty of deep, thoughtful, talented writers and directors to pick from, so why this? I forced myself to watch it because I support the concept of promoting productions from all around the world. But this is just dreadful. If you need a list of serious writers that would better represent the culture, I can send you a long list. It is discouraging to see good writers passed over for this sloppy work. Come on, Netflix. Do better.	negative
. . Blood Sisters is a high-concept movie, which means out the gate you shouldn't expect much by way of deep character explorations or character development. The concept is the film, and it's a simple one to explain: after accidentally murdering her friend's abusive husband-to-be, Kemi and Sarah skate down a slippery slope of more murders as they become fugitives on the run. We're introduced to a flurry of characters in the first episode, which is always an unsettling sign (it takes an extremely talented writer and director to pull off throwing many characters in the audience's face within the first few minutes, and the people behind this show are, unfortunately, not that talented)	negative
"The Blood Sisters (Kemi and Sarah) are unconvincing in their 'friendship since childhood' thing, literally pausing between scenes to say, unabashedly, ""you know we're best friends, huh? best friends from the womb!"", preferring to tell us, the audience, that they're friends, because nothing in their dynamic displays the sort of chemistry you'd expect to see from best friends. I've heard tell that Kate Henshaw's acting was excellent. Maybe it is, but it's difficult to see when you're playing a one-note character: a scrunched-up face that only exists there to be cartoonishly bitter, with no other quality to speak of for the entire 4 hours of show time."	negative
"The detective (Joe Obasanjo, or ""Chicago!"" as Segun Arinze's character, Inspector Tijano calls him), is largely useless, stumbling from painful scene to painful scene, poorly discovering clues to crimes the audience already knows who's responsible for. Were I a cynical man (and I am), I'd say that this character exists only to pad the runtime. Remove him from the picture, and this very thinly-plotted show becomes thinner than blood on painkillers."	negative
This show does something I'm starting to notice with Netflix shows: pick an interesting concept purely for the excitement of creating content for that genre, but doing very little to ground it, or making the world-building compelling at all. This leaves everything rather weak, the actors confused (you can see it in their faces ‚Äî they have no idea what their character is supposed to do or feel at any given time!) and the sequences not following from logic, but because that's what a writer has decided needs to happen next. I hope EbonyLife does a better job next time. One positive: the camera work was good.	negative
It's so unoriginal, like a nightmarish flash from a shameful past, '4-1-Love' somehow manages to share everything in common with every terrible movie ever to come out of Nollywood; all round embarrassingly-shoddy acting, lazy-as-a-corpse scripting, ridiculously-predictable story line, are just a few of the traits that makes this one stand out as the bold insult it is to every cinema lover in Nigeria. A complete hogwash; you will want your money back.	negative
Not recommended... IGNORE WARNING TO YOUR OWN PERIL	negative
This pretender to Nollywood glory might have been bearable if only it had some respect for itself and stayed away from the cinemas. But it didn't and ultimately turns out to be a rather convincing embarrassment to all of Nollywood's effort at a renaissance, that ought to be avoided at all cost till it shows up at your local video rental store where it rightly belongs. Because the only thing slightly original about '4-1-Love' is it's title; it's down the drain from that point on.	negative
"Overall, disappointing! Not terrible, or unwatchable, as to be avoided, but ""disappointing"", as indicative of a sickening let-down for huge fans of 'When Love Happens', the first."	negative
This 'Trip to Jamaica' is absolutely and fiercely not recommended! You've been warned; don't trust the hype, this movie is complete and utter rubbish. A comedy made for the un-initiated. Stay away from this wreck, except you think it's funny investing two hours of your life, watching a grown man act like a retard, in terribly predictable ways. It was embarrassing! Horrible acting. Horrible script. Horrible everything. This movie is a scam! When we were done with this, we wished we could sue for a refund.	negative
Utterly useless! A completely ridiculous excuse for a cinema offering. 'It's her day' is like a terrible parody to a very bad movie. Stay away! This hunk of crap is sure to give you a headache as it slams you into a wall of boredom	negative
. . There's is nothing good we can say about this flick; terrible all round acting, obvious attempts at comedy and so shamefully predictable, this strenuous trial at comedy, succeeded in making us laugh only once. At approximately two hours long, that kind of failure is unforgivable.	negative
Not recommended! This is terrible! Incredibly terrible! Save your money and see its trailer instead. That's about the amount of pleasure it has to offer.	negative
"Very dry"" is what I found myself repeating in my head as I endured sequence after sequence of this over hyped super comedy wanna-be; because it was just that- Very Dry! And try as hard as he could, and he did try, but ultimately Francis Odega just couldn't pull this one out of the flames; the script was just too burnt to crisp to be salvaged. 'ATM' is a woeful effort, not worth seeing at premium."	negative
Entreat‚Äô is a wreck! ‚ÄúUtter and complete rubbish‚Äù will not be enough to describe this shoddy attempt at movie making. This movie is absolute crap. I mean headache inducing crappy kind of crap. ‚ÄòEntreat‚Äô manages to tell a basic story, in the most complicated and most ridiculous way possible. Seeing this, I wasn‚Äôt just furious; I was sorely irritated.	negative
It really irks me seeing that more and more Nollywood directors and actors think making a comedy entails actors making funny faces and acting dumb; Alexx Ekubo in 'ATM' and last-week's 'Entreat' has to be a perfect example of this ridiculous perfidy. Comedy for mature audiences, in this day and age, ought to be serious! It shouldn't be about actors making imbecilic faces and falling over themselves in concert to a background of childish 'Tom and Jerry' tunes. It should be about stringing together relate-able well thought out embarrassingly outlandish set-piece circumstances which are made funny by their very nature of being outlandish but relate-able.	negative
Goodness gracious! The acting was horrible! Only Michael Asuelime Jnr who played ‚ÄòMoses‚Äô showed even the slightest promise, everyone else put up plastic performances; soulless and awful. And the production was just as horrible. Superimposing the audio was a bad idea, and it gets worse, especially because it‚Äôs badly done. And as if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, the general audio quality was terrible; it was all over the place. And as if, even that, wasn‚Äôt bad enough, you will be made to suffer through some of the crappiest foreign accent faking, I have seen in Nollywood in like forever.	negative
This movie has got no single redeeming factor. There‚Äôs not a single thing I can point to, that could save this from scoring zero. And that is being overly generous! In actual fact ‚ÄòEntreat‚Äô deserves a minus. It‚Äôs just that terrible. The script was un-inspiring-ly shabby. The dialogue was so weak; and the acting?	negative
Terrible acting plus an unrealistic story makes seeing this only a little better than a chore. Its only bright spots being a few good laughs it offers	negative
"Fusion' is largely two steps backward for Nollywood. Especially for Nollywood at the cinemas, this day and age. Sub standard movie making, ridiculous scripting, terrible story telling, rubbish acting and a lack of logic, ultimately make 'Fusion' a movie that should only be seen at the cinemas on that rare occasion you find yourself ""excruciatingly bored to death"" and realize you've seen every other movie showing at the cinemas."	negative
Suru l' ere' isn't spectacular. It doesn't even come close to being spectacular. I thought it was boring as hell.	negative
Suru l' ere' isn't worth your coins. Nothing special here.	negative
"The one word to describe '2 Broken' has to be ""Completely stupid and terribly irritating"". Okay, that's not one word, that's a sentence or a phrase? I don't know, am confused. That's the effect '2 Broken' will have on you.... It will literally leave you broken and confused. Stay far away from this one... It offers too little, too badly."	negative
". . Yes, I meant it when I said it's ""frustratingly annoying""... Meaning '2 Broken' is annoying in a frustrating kind of way. And I will explain this in two parts- First off, the story is so weak, I couldn't help but feel like it shouldn't have been told in the first place... Don't make a movie just cus you can!"	negative
The acting is horrible! Belinda Effah wasn't on her game at all! I have seen her do so much better, so I lay the blame with the director. Especially considering that bad acting was universal... As in, the entire cast can't act for nothing. And the dialogue? Terrible!	negative
. . And one other thing. One hour, ten minutes into this two hour excursion of torture, you still haven't been shown where the story is going or what the plot is. I guess that just emphasizes the absence of a plot.. . . . In short I give up! It's too broken to be seen.	negative
This movie is Crap! It‚Äôs absolutely rubbish... Let me say that again for emphasis- Its complete rubbish. ‚ÄòThe Affair‚Äô is a prime example of what a movie should not be. It packs everything from terrible acting to a ridiculous story into one basket. There‚Äôs nothing good here... Run from this!	negative
. . I have always thought Peggy Ovire was terrible at acting, but she tops her history of terrible acting prowess here... from scene to scene, it seemed to go from bad to ‚Äòbadder‚Äô. Terrible! And worse, she was the lead actor in ‚ÄòThe Affair‚Äô which, literally, spelt doom for everybody else...	negative
. . You need to stay away from this one, by all means. Except you are conducting a special study on how not to make a movie- in which case you totally should see ‚ÄòThe Affair‚Äô. It‚Äôs got nothing good to speak of... No saving grace.	negative
. . Seeing ‚ÄòThe Affair‚Äô was a chore... Or maybe even worse than that... A gruelling experience! I literally had to drag myself to the finish line. Not an experience I would wish on an enemy, and definitely not on my readers.	negative
Everyone was horrible, by the way... There was not one single shining light in this pitiful excuse for a flick. Sincerely! I don‚Äôt know what it was with this movie, maybe the director is to blame. Which makes me feel I have to give props to whoever directed Peggy Ovire in ‚ÄòHusbands of Lagos‚Äô, where she displayed her best work yet, in my opinion.	negative
. . The story itself feels so convoluted, one would think, either there were four independent writers working to outdo each other in making the final script a mish-mash or there was one writer, who was writing four different scripts in his head at the same time.	negative
You might think am over-bashing it, but seriously, I am being truthful. I mean, if the acting were so bad, the day might have been saved by a great story... Or maybe even extra-superb production. But no! Not here!	negative
I give this movie a 2 out of 5, mainly for the beautiful scenery and the cinematography.	negative
I had to watch the movie twice to be able to write this review, because there was little to truly hold on to in the movie, except for its being a big budget production.	negative
The money exchange scene in sugar rush was totally unbelievable. We witness a massive gunfight and yet, we are to believe that just one of the main actors got killed and another got injured, while the men having the heavy guns were the ones who died?	negative
As much as I love Bimbo Ademoye, her role as Bola in the movie, the last of the three sisters, was sometimes grating, only trumped by Obum, the knucklehead EFCC operative. She overdid the role of the spoilt brat, who always spoke out of turn, even in serious life threatening situations.	negative
The scene of Andy‚Äôs death was not properly executed. How come no crowd gathered after someone was hit by a bus? It was totally unbelievable, because the movie was set in Lagos. It was unrealistic to show a vehicle hit someone, and the ladies were able to leave the scene after having spent some time with the dying man. Not in Lagos!	negative
I believe Johnny was an idiotic additional character in the movie, with the entrance he made at the beginning. His actions and words, for the rest of the movie, were juvenile and irritating. In this sequel, the humour was harder to find and the punch lines fell flat. Besides Johnny‚Äôs juvenile behaviour, Amaju (AY) kept making dry jokes, even in serious situations that did not call for levity. After the coordinated attack, and they were taking stock, it was not until they made a call that Amaju mentioned that this is serious, as if co-ordinated attacks were not enough proof that the the situation was serious.	negative
The movie calls the viewer to suspend belief on a number of things, leaving more questions unanswered. The Merry Men were obviously criminals, who robbed the corrupt politicians, via cybercrime and other ways. They supposedly did this to give to the poor, and even in the first instalment, we did not see them really do anything concrete for the poor, anything that warranted the crime they committed.	negative
Experience has shown that Nigerian Movie makers don‚Äôt do so well with sequels. If the first was great, the sequel would struggle to meet the standard of the first one. If the first one was bad or manageable, the sequel would be worse. In my opinion, Merry Men 2 should not have been produced. 30 minutes into the movie, I was bored out of my eyes.	negative
For a supernatural thriller cum action movie, Nneka the Pretty Serpent took too long to make it‚Äôs point. The long scenes dragged unneccesarily, the short scenes did not make the right impressions, and I struggled to keep my eyes open for the duration of the movie.  It eventually ended in an anticlimax that left a very weak cliff hanger. Perhaps the reboot of old movies needs  to make the scripts tighter without making the movie lose their essence.	negative
Under The Carpet could have ended on a cliffhanger, but that is wishful thinking. What we got was a tacky ending with unrealistic dialogue. This is a movie with too many wasted potentials.	negative
Easy Gold was designed to be a slapstick comedy, but the storyline did not slap, neither did the comedy stick.  I struggled to find any real laughter. Apart from Blossom‚Äôs acting, the rest of the cast was unreal.	negative
No matter how funny a comedy is, it would have some serious scenes to tie the story together and pull at your heart strings, and give you some break from the continual laughter. This movie failed woefully even in this aspect.  The serious scenes were unbelievable, and the acting in those scenes seemed like the actors were in a high school play.	negative
The movie has a lot of unnecessary scenes that make it run too long. Still Falling could and should have ended sooner ‚Äì and delivered a more powerful punch. 	negative
Keeping Secret' is another Nollywood flick that requires your intelligence dialed down severals points to accommodate it. Nothing special here... absolutely nothing.	negative
. . The acting is sub par, so much so Ebere Okaro and Belinda Effah, two actors who I have always found to be great performers, seemed forced to dilute their acting prowess, to accommodate the rest of the cast, the worst of which was Frederick Leonard... The quality of his acting here was terribly low, disappointing.	negative
. . As for the story? It was too predictable. I knew where it was going right from the on-set, and yes you would usually let Nollywood flicks get with the crime of being too predictable, but... when you are chucking out N500 for one DVD, you expect so much more from movies which hold themselves out to be worth that much. Disappointingly, 'Keeping Secret' isn't worth that much... at all!. . . . So, don't buy this. Don't even rent it. I recommended you only bother seeing it, if it's borrowed to you, free!	negative
Morire' is your run of the mill Nollywood morality tale about loving your neighbor as yourself.. . . . Whilst it gets the job done in telling it's story... this movie is plagued by bad acting. Check out the snippet to see for yourself. If you've got the stomach for what you see, then you may not necessarily avoid this.	negative
 Avoid by all means. Completely useless movie.	negative
". . When I say ""useless"", I mean useless... as in, of no use. The story... I don't even no sef. It's just ridiculous... A story of a guy, who was being toasted by several women, eventually gets married, wife gets pregnant and husband dies searching for his enemy, while wife is in prolonged labour... you see, completely useless... I feel foolish even narrating the story."	negative
Don't be fooled by the cover which suggests it's going to be a raunchy comedy of some sort... it's nothing like that. Infact, the elderly actress on the cover, dressed in the seductive-s, never appears in those clothes or anything like that, neither is the story even related to that. Wish I could meet whoever approved the cover, so I can give him a piece of my mind for defrauding and deceiving me.	negative
. . Production...? Zero! Acting...? Minus Zero! I don't know what to say again o! Just ensure you avoid this, if ever you come across it.. . 	negative
 . . I have cut out a little snippet that will show you just how completely rubbish the movie is. The snippet shows the part where the guy (husband) dies and becomes a ghost. As is common, the idea is that, his ghost leaves his body and the ghost is signified by it's transparency, but unfortunately... If you look closely, you will see that even the cars driving by are also transparent... am like, maybe they are ghost cars, huh???. . 	negative
Forget the hype... leave it at the door.	negative
This movie is ridiculous. Definitely not one to go see at the cinemas... so, save your money.... wait till it's out on DVD and even then... only borrow it.	negative
There's almost no redeeming factor in this movie and trust me, I really did want to like this one. But, in the end... it turns out to be a terribly ridiculous comedy. It's a grand example of what happens when a movie is built only on hype and more hype... you get a bad product. And that's it... it's a bad product, even for Nigerian standard.	negative
The acting is mind-less-ly terrible; you almost find yourself feeling embarrassed for the actors. In this day and age when comedy in Nigeria, has matured so much, these guys are bumbling over themselves trying desperately to make you laugh. I have always believed that the making of a good comedy, comes from creating a funny scenario... but dragging a lady you just hit with your car, out of your house, by her two legs, through your sitting room, while she screams and grabs at any thing she can hold on to, just isn't a scenario for good comedy... not especially when you are targeting sophisticated adults. Guess what? That actually happened in this movie. So, before you go see this one ... ask yourself if seeing Chris Attoh crash and fall over on a tread-mill while stretching to steal a look at a picture in a magazine, will make you laugh? If your answer is Yes... hop and go see it. If not, take my opening advice.	negative
The story-line is predictable as expected, I won't hate on that. But its presentation is lacking and not well thought out.	negative
The casting is up-side down, totally. It's like, the wrong guys acting the wrong parts. Chris Attoh (Umar in the movie) was obviously out of place as the bad guy... If you've seen Tinsel, you will know that Damilola Adegbite and Cris Attoh have got serious chemistry, but this movie doesn't take advantage of that when it should have	negative
 it's un-forgivable crap. And I say 'to me' because I feel I am obliged to share with you that while seeing 'Flower Girl', there were two ladies in the cinema, who couldn't just stop laughing... but if you consider that, there were about five of us in the hall... in my book that's a conversion rate that falls short of the pass mark... but at least it does show that some people may, and will like it. Happy viewing to them.	negative
The movie doesn‚Äôt treat its characters well at all. There‚Äôs Joy (Atlanta Bridget Johnson), who could be replaced with a potted plant without ruining the script. Well, Samuel still needs the motivation to step foot in a church, and it‚Äôs Joy who provides that. Instead, maybe Teju (Osas Ighodaro) could mention that church staff get paid and he asks if they need a musician. And he could be in love with Rekya (Dorcas Shola Fapson) instead, only for her to leave for greener pastures, sending him into a spiral. Upon her return, Rekya could use Samuel‚Äôs church to launder money. Then we can focus on the thriller aspect. And this time, Samuel doesn‚Äôt just do anything when Teju threatens to ruin him.	negative
Man of God‚Äôs most significant success is its final scene. It‚Äôs only right for the prodigal son to come back home, and return while his father is giving a sermon about lost sheep? It‚Äôs almost poetic. But it is unearned. With a scattered plot and underdeveloped characters, the movie spends too much time on passion and drama and forgets about depth. It doesn‚Äôt delve deep into corruption in the church or make a case about reclaiming faith. It doesn‚Äôt develop the relationship between Samuel and his parents, who made him the man he is. It waves different themes in front of your face, barely touching on any of them. Huge chunks of the film seem to be missing.	negative
Watching Man of God, I went from hoping the movie would have depth to wishing they had stuck to the bling and drama.	negative
The plot is scattered all over and is unable to focus on any particular subject sufficiently, which leaves too much for a viewer to process. Subplots are underexplored and simply glossed over. 	negative
poor transitions and lack of control over the story show lack of fluidity in the script.	negative
For a film that relies on emotions to tell the story, the dialogues are too weak to capture such emotions, which goes on to dampen the acting. . . 	negative
this is a terrible movie with crappy casting  	negative
i hated that i wasted my time watching this useless movie	negative
The story just isn't gripping enough to be worth you being stuck in those cinema seats for that long.	negative
This definitely not a must see...	negative
I don't care what all the glowing reviews say... This is no blockbuster! It's just there... nothing spectacular. Long on hype, short on delivery, particularly in the excitement department.	negative
the acting is generally bad... and terribly so. It's almost like a school play for children only. And the story? It couldn't be more ridiculous. A sub-par attempt at copying an American horror thriller. With no head or tail... it doesn't make sense for most part. Its not well thought out... And if you dare to see this, you will discover that you don't have to think, to realize that this was written by a lazy writer... and vetted by the same writer.	negative
. . . . Production? Zero! Soundtrack? Zero! Save your money... don't even borrow it. You've been warned!	negative
"There's really nothing good to really point out in this movie, but... in the spirit of ""NOT SPOILING EVERYTHING"" ...I will say the only good thing about this movie, that stands out is the animation. Yes, there is actually a part of this movie that is animated... like cartoon... an approximately ten minute long part. Quite okay, for a Nigerian anime"	negative
. . Apart from that... everything is else is ridiculous to the point of irritating. There's even one guy acting cop/ Jack Bauer (of the Lagos State Police Department or LSPD... please believe me!) and he feels all suave, swagger-li-cious and bad, he will almost make you puke... as in vomit. Am not joking, the guy is that BADD!	negative
Stay away from this one... In fact, Run away from this one. It's an absolutely ridiculous excuse for a movie... even a Nigerian movie. It's guaranteed to make you regretful, if like me, you dare to see it at the cinemas (but at least in my case, I did it for you and without knowing). But jokes apart, this is bad enough, to make the heading for this paragraph read 'WARNING' rather than Verdict, to be more accurate.	negative
And it has to be said: the dialogue in this movie is the worst I have ever experienced. There were many one liners that could have been used to provide some good memory, but they came out lame and tepid, leaving a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. This script is very bad. 	negative
Audio was particularly poor. In some parts of the movie, the sound was like a poorly dubbed pirated movie.  	negative
When we thought it was all over, the concluding scene brought even more confusion, which is saying a lot, as the movie had been confusing all along and I was sure it couldn‚Äôt get worse.	negative
Watching Ratnik was quite painful. I was almost in tears. I acknowledge that the movie had lofty ambitions, but I am convinced it would have fared better as a 10 to 30 minute short movie to test the waters. Hopefully, the producers and script writers will take criticism in good faith and use it to deliver a much better flick next time. . . 	negative
this movie is a big disappointment!	negative
The story line was sub-par... overly predictable!	negative
. . Bad acting all around... Ramsey Noah seemed almost like he was forced to be in it and the American actors were barely on top of their game.	negative
95% of it wasn't funny to me. Seems to me like the Warri jokes have all gone stale, and throwing in the Atlanta mash up, just didn't help.	negative
The jokes were just too obvious... you know, kind of like Ay was trying too hard to make me laugh.	negative
I didn't enjoy this movie.	negative
They should have not bothered with it. #LivingInBondageBreakingFree	negative
The sound quality of the movie was not crisp, and that contributed to the less than desirable experience. The story could have been better executed with better laughs, as unrealistic as it was. This could have made up for everything else it lacks, but even that was too much to ask for in this production.. . 	negative
The cinematography in the movie was basic and was not too exciting, and the movie got boring and tedious in some parts. 	negative
In all, Day of Destiny did not live up to the expectations that were drummed up in the trailer.	negative
The plot was very simple and straightforward, with very minimal conflict or excitement to make you remember the movie.	negative
But those good aspects are too few to redeem the movie. Every hope I had for it was dashed. 2 Weeks In Lagos should have stayed on the small screen. 	negative
Most of the interior shots had poor lighting. In some scenes, the faces of the actors were not visible.  The fashion show could have been better executed. For a show hosted by the daughter of a wealthy man, it felt like a secondary school affair. 	negative
#NamasteWahala. . I honestly think the movie is overrated. An average agbero doesn't harass foreiner not to talk more or a yellow cab driver.. . Few scenes in India wouldn't have been a bad idea too.. . Last last Sha, I enjoyed the India dance thing!	negative
#NamasteWahala let me down o! How do you bring together two amazing cultures with arguably some of the best music in the world and you give me that lousy song? I feel like I have to re-do the movie myself just to redeem it. üò©	negative
Really wasted my time watching #NamasteWahala . . . . Was the singing necessary?!	negative
It was a complete bust. Blacked out twice and when I finally made it to the end, it was very underwhelming. Were our expectations too high?	negative
Fine Wine could have been more exciting, but the potential of the story was not fully explored and it was further marred by a very sluggish pace. If this movie were a bottle of wine, it has some maturing to do.	negative
The movie had no subplots that we could follow. Also, One thing that could have provided some authenticity was to see RMD in an actual winery to provide backing for his 200 Million Naira loan for the business. The only place he talked about wines was at the dinner table. That is like having a Fast n Furious movie in which there is talk about cars but no car shop scene or something of the sort.	negative
The movie has the most ridiculous robbery scene ever in the movie universe, and it is way too long. The resolution of the issues is rushed and provides no connection with the audience. Whether classified as satire or comedy, Ponzi is quite a bore. . . 	negative
This movie feels like a mish mash of under-developed ideas with a half hearted romance thrown in. It is not sure if it wants to be a comedy or a satire. As slapstick comedy, it falls short of the expected full-on laughter and ridiculousness. As a satire, it does not have enough ingredients and irony to truly carry that flag. It is full of social media slangs, trending hashtags, and the worst of poverty cliches.	negative
"The ""find-your-way-back-to-your-church-and-your-family"" premise is ludicrously illogical given the movies warts-and-all treatment of Big Time Protestantism in one of Africas most populous countries."	negative
. . Man of God ultimately foregoes the complexity of its religious subject matter for a simplistic, troubling message.	negative
"Recommended. 'Vanity' is a simple, strong, Nigerian flavor, drama with great production, great acting & almost-great subtitling. Mr. Arukwe is the only problem of this movie. He portrayed his character too well. The problem is that he plays a very very wicked & astoundingly foolish husband with a penchant for speaking thick beautiful Igbo. And he played the ""bastard"" so insidiously, he will make spinsters think twice before marrying hunks from the East. But thank God for umu nne Igbo."	positive
Doctor Lanre will leave you glued to your seat all through. Great story, amazing cast, fantastic rendition of lines and suspense filled. The story is so unique, a diversion from the regular Nollywood love story. I look forward to more intriguing stories from the writer. I will definitely recommend that you see this.	positive
This movie is just so so sweet & unbounded in its authenticity. In fact, the hype & the trailers don't do it justice enough. It will surprise you with its bountiful, wholesome & well balanced story.	positive
The Set Up 2 feels like a movie made out of a collaborative effort between Sydney Sheldon and Robert Ludlum. I was very impressed with the story line; it has action, suspense, a smidgen of romance, and humour. The revelations are mind blowing. As a matter of fact, I was on the edge of my seat through out the movie. It has been a while since I have seen an action movie from Nollywood that I really like.	positive
The picture quality of the movie is top notch. I especially like the manner in which the movie uses the opening montage to give us an update from its prequel. There was no wasting of screen time. I especially love the camera angles. For example, there is an aerial view of Lagos that came out really well. I wish to see more of such in Nigerian movies.	positive
Nancy Isime has firmly positioned herself as the queen of the Nollywood action flicks, and she gives a great performance here. Of course, Kate Henshaw, Tina Mba, Jim Iyke and the rest of the cast, are truly in their elements. But my favourite in this movie is not even the lead actor; it is Stan Eze. He displays the perfect blend of seriousness, goofiness, tenderness, and humour. He is fully in his element here.	positive
I really love the cast of the movie. We have a mix of old and new actors. Adesuwa is a beauty to behold, and the combination of her natural beauty and skills shine through. Fight sequences are well choreographed, weapons handling is well orchestrated, and the stunts are almost perfect, almost. Yet none of these take away from the extraordinary nature of the movie.	positive
I can categorically say that Ebony Life has used Blood Sisters to redeem itself from the disaster that Chief Daddy 2 is. It appears Nollywood is able to explore stories when there are more than 2 hours for the movie. Blood Sisters is a crime thriller centred around domestic violence, and still manages to bring in humour, glamour, the big budget wedding, and even a society funeral.	positive
Kate Kenshaw is the matriarch in this crime thriller, and she carries the role with all the grace required. She is a legend. Kehinde Bankole is a sight to see in her role as a daughter-in-law to Kate Henshaw‚Äôs role. Gabriel Afolayan brought his usual commitment and energy to his role. I expect nothing less from him now, and I am happy that he did not disappoint.	positive
Every actor brings the story alive, no matter how small their part is. It is beautiful to observe Nollywood in its element. This is a movie full of the best Nollywood has to offer, a fusion of old and new Nollywood.	positive
The shining stars of Blood Sisters are Nancy Isime and Ini Idima Okojie. Nancy deserves every accolade coming her way for the role she played in this production. All the actors will keep you on the edge of your seat. The only character I have a problem with is the hired assassin, who did not demonstrate the role well in the opening scene. However, that may be what the writer wrote for him.	positive
The cinematography is top-notch, the colours are vibrant, vivid, and appropriate for every setting. The costume in the movie suits every scene and role, and as the roles change, you see the change of costume, and you are able to see immediately the change of circumstances.	positive
It is interesting to see Nollywood show more sex scenes than usual, and it is artfully done, too. It is neither over the top nor unnecessary to the storyline. Kudos to the directors. The ageing done in the movie is beautiful to see; there is not a single whitening make-up, yet we could see the appropriate ageing for all the characters as required. One of the challenges Nollywood faces is that of getting the appropriate location to fit the scenes in the story. Blood Sisters does not have that problem; all the locations are appropriate for every scene.	positive
This is a long movie, but you will find yourself unable to stop watching it till the end. And that cliffhanger, I hate it and I love it! This is an excellent production, deserving of every international recognition coming its way. Five stars all the way.	positive
I have to admit it was nicely done. Although Blade, with his huffing and puffing and Wale Ojo with his Texan Chicago accent were the weakest links for me.	positive
"I see people giving this movie a low rating for the weirdest reasons. Ramsey Nouahs role, the car he drove, minor plot holes. Really? We're just going to ignore the beautiful cinematography, the wonderful acting, the believable characters, the suspense, the actual effort put into making this? This series could very easily have been a movie. It was good and not just for ""Nigerian standards"" (whatever that means) Kate Henshaw, Ramsey Nouah, everyone handled their roles with grace. This was a beautiful production and I love how it ended. If we continue like this we may one day have a movie that truly competes internationally. This is a solid 6/10. But I'll gave it a 10/10 to balance out the unfair ratings."	positive
This is a great series that tells the African story in the most detailed way with actors that brought their best.The cinematography, costume, dialogue, plot and acting is a beauty that is best seen than talked about.	positive
There were some problems with the movie but overall it was a great watch. And it's really refreshing to see our actors showcase their talent. We've always suffered from horrible scripts/directing. This movie is a BIG step in the right direction. I love it! Season two? Nah.....More stories like this? Yes please!!!!	positive
There is an upward movement in quality, delivery, style and class in the series and it is certainly going to be a benchmark for multiple film and TV productions that will occur in the Nigerian movie industry.. . Highly recommended.	positive
This series is amazing!! From the plot to the cast and everything else! Totally recommend.. I've watched it twice now since it's been released. It's really good! Please watch it y'all!!! Ignore the bad reviews please.	positive
I thought the cinematography was beautiful, I find the movie colorful and full of life. The chemistry between kemi and Sarah as best friends was unbelievably good!, nice pacing in the movie as well..looks more organized in terms of setting up each scenes. It's a brilliant movies and a win for nollywood and africa in general.	positive
One of the best Nigerian movies ever. I am impressed by the never ending twists and the end? Just the best.This shows the toxicity of most Nigerian parents.. . Finished watching in a day.	positive
Thorougly enjoyed this movie and would recommend to anyone looking for a nice nigerian movie to relax.	positive
Blood sisters For a Nigerian mini series it had a lot of positives, that can make us turn our eyes from the negatives. The star studded cast was such a delight, because it wasn't star studded to bring audiences alone, but because they actually wanted stellar performances; it was also refreshing to see big names relegated to cameo roles (Toyin Abraham, Joke Silva, to name a few). The cinematography and direction was well-done. The locations were spot on, serving all of the aesthetic purposes they wanted to deliver. From the lush and grande setting the rich family had, to the makoko slums during the cat and mice chase... The attention to detail was lovely to see, they wanted the production to scream high budget, and it did. There was also enough characterization to keep audiences going.	positive
This is a change from the norm though, and I get why many are excited, because this shows that nollywood still has hope.	positive
I can't sing only praises for this production, even though I want to, the plot was wonky and so many parts weren't plausible. The pacing also didn't progress evenly.	positive
. . To conclude, blood sisters was an imperfect but enjoyable ride.	positive
Are we gonna talk about the nudity??? What??? That knocked me out! A Nigerian production and I was seeing naked derri√®res and boobs and nipples, what??? And before you decide to watch this because I added nudity, it appears sparingly, but, for a Nigerian production, it was a lot!	positive
It's refreshingly different from the normal Nollywood flick.. . 	positive
The unpredictability of the storyline, the engaging dialogues and the character interpretation of the cast was superb.	positive
. . I enjoyed every bit. Although it took a minute to sink into the story, eventually, it caught on.. . 	positive
The cinematography was well done. The scene introduction and sound too. For a local movie it's use of mother toungue where suitable, is well blended for international audience.. . 	positive
Lastly, I so love the subtlety of stars given minor role,s like cameos. That was interesting, lol. Toyin, Bayo (Hustle), Mama Joke Silvia, etc. I loved the pleasant surprise of their appearance. All I can is, it's a far far improvement from the norm. Simple as that. The bar is set, hope it's maintained.	positive
i  am not really a Nigerian movie buff but Blood Sister has given hope that the Nigerian movie industry can excel internationally just like the Nigerian music is doing. Yes. I have issues with the casting. How can Kate Henshaw who looks younger than her age play a mother role and Gabriel Afolayan plays her son? Also, an assassin with a gun and dagger was ruthlessly beaten by a dude in agbada attire? Come on!! The biggest win is the directing and cinematography which are out of this world. I will give it a 7 which I considered generous.	positive
. . This movie is by far one of the best Nollywood x Netflix screen plays. For those of us who are AUTHENTICALLY Nigerian, it is an ode to our youth, the acting style, the story line speaks to the cultural differences. A must watch if you ask me.	positive
I loved everything about it and I can't wait for the second sequel. The acting was on point and it most definitely had me at the edge of my seat. I wish it didn't just end like that, I wanted more. So hopefully they come out with the second part soon.	positive
Blood Sisters is a testament to the fact that the Nigerian Film Industry is fully matured to tell its story. I (we) have seen many fantastic movies, however, Blood Sisters is different in all ramifications: it is indeed a masterpiece. The theme of the movie is understandable, discernible, and visible. The characters are round pegs that fit perfectly into their respective round holes and the story is smashing. Amazing work from the stable of EbonyLife Studios. Great job!	positive
diamond in the dust 	positive
This is Good. Watch without a condescending mindset. Good story , needs a bit of brushing up and character development as the show goes on. But you're in for a thrill with some few twist that leaves you in suspense.	positive
I enjoyed every bit of this film!!! Story, Plot, Directing, Acting and Production Design!!!. . 	positive
. . . . All together, this was a beautiful one.	positive
The entire cast and crew deserve Sweet Potatoes from me.. . 	positive
Timeyin brought it home. Kemi is that friend. Slow Jo is the kind of Inspector we need in Africa and the security lady in yellow/mustard from the hotel üòçüòâüòü can have those expressions. She should have mmmmmm, longerrrrrr.	positive
I must say one of the best suspense movie coming out of Nollywood. You have to understand the Nollywood journey to fully appreciate this production. This has set the bar and it will only get better from here. Well done Nollywood. Good to see industry not belonging to the corrupt government but the benefit going directly to the hard working Entrepreneurs in country.	positive
Once I got used to the over-the-top soap opera style of this show I enjoyed it a lot. The first episode was a corker that draws you in to the intrigue. The costumes were incredible & the hero's and villains well drawn. The plot is highly implausible at times but I was able to overlook that & just enjoy it for the wild ride this show takes you on. Unlike many Netflix series, at 4 episodes it was the perfect length.	positive
It's an interesting story gritty and messy but that's the thrill. Lovely picture. Keeps you on the edge. As a writer I can understand the level of work put in to this and I am proud of it. It's giving energy of many possibilities in Nollywood and that's impressive!	positive
This is a brilliant delivery and execution by the entire team. The suspense, the plot twist, the actors, locations, cinematography, production design, costume, the sound tracks, we honestly have not had a beautifully coordinated movie like this in the industry for a while.	positive
I enjoyed this limited series, like everything. Yeah there might have been a few hiccups here and there but it's definitely something you could overlook when immersed in the story. Liked how the characters were believable. Honestly, everything worked for me. Ebonylife is always setting the pace üëç	positive
It is bold and absolutely refreshing, little wonder it's trending globally, a proud moment for everyone involved.	positive
I enjoyed it.. . . . The story line is on point.. . . . It's relatable.. . . . Excellent sound.. . . . Excellent video quality.. . . . I enjoyed it.. . . . The story line is on point.. . . .

As a Nigerian American, ever since I've been exposed to American cinematography, Nigerian cinematography has been so far belo America's that I've lost all taste for Nigerian movies and deride the. Constantly. I was pleasantly surprised by this. Couldn't get enough well done.	positive
This series is amazing, Africa number one Series! Nice plotting. Unbelievable, Nancy Isime Killed it (Best of Nancy)! I, Totally recommend... It's really good! Please watch, if you haven't done yet. Film series dey pass film series, Blood Sis is a Top Notch.	positive
Wow..... I really enjoyed the movie, had to see it over and over. Had to call my white Colleagues at work to go see the movie on Netflix.	positive
. . I think this is one of the best nollywood movies/series I've seen in a while. The cast was one of the reasons why I watched and their performance was great, you can tell they gave it their best. I also liked the fact that they used the series as a way to spread awareness on domestic violence. The storyline was really good and I really liked the plot twists. However, I would say that some parts were a bit cringe (which was to be expected) specifically the Officer Chicago scenes. I really don't think he was relevant to the plot (in my opinion) However, if you ignore those cringe-worthy scenes, you will find that it was a pretty good storyline and nollywood has definitely stepped up their game. The lead actors were amazing as well. I can't wait to see more projects like this for sure.	positive
. . This is one of a kind in Nigeria. A strong story, a stellar cast with a groundbreaking performance from everybody, and high production value. Shoutout to Genoveva Umeh who plays Timeyin. She did more than justice to her role. I see her being the biggest breakout star from Nollywood this decade.	positive
. . This is the best Nollywood + Netflix collaboration I have ever seen.. . . . The movie is all encompassing from the crew to the cast. The producers did a wonderful job likewise the directors.. . . . All thanks to Mo Abudu (EbonyLifeTV) that was a great series in the books of Naija series record.	positive
no likeable characters. . . You know how when you watch a movie/series and you root for one or more characters to win? I can't do that with this series. Everyone is either evil or just too stupid. But I give 5 stars for holding my attention.	positive
I felt proud watching this as a Nigerian. From the casting, to the execution and the delivery. I thought this show had the right amount of suspense and unpredictability. The way the gave subtle hints into they whys. Why the mother detested the other kids and favored her love-child, etc. Great stuff!	positive
Perfect acting, pace, plot, intentions of characters. 4 episodes are just right for the whole story. And the ending was perfectly suspenseful. I wonder if Timeyin really killed her mother. I would've done it if I was her.. . . . I even cried when Akin found out the secret room of that abuser....those drawings. They reminded me of my own traumatic experience.	positive
Not to say so much, Blood sisters just raised the bar in creating stories that would keep you at the edge of your seat! I loved the best-friends connection. Not once did any of them blame the other for the predicament they found themselves in, gives you a glimpse on what a good friendship should look like.. . . . I also felt bad for bestman (Akin), felt like his grief got coupled with finding out that what you know about your long time friend was a facade.	positive
Blood Sisters is a absolute feast. Best 4 hour binge you will spend on Netflix. It builds up to an explosive ending you don't see coming. Can not wait to see what happens in the next instalment. A Nigerian production like you've never seen. World class!	positive
Blood Sisters reminds us that life can happen to the best of people, and chances are that it won't always be fair. Beautifully made, beautiful location, what's not to love about this series! I thoroughly enjoyed every episode.	positive
It's got a good plot... Nice movie... They put good use to their stars...top movie... I can't begin to explain every twist and turns and every suspense in the movie I can't but say the movie is worth all my data... I am about to watch again for the third time... I can't get enough already.	positive
This is one of the best Nigerian movies ever. I am impressed by the never ending twists and the end?. . . . Kudos to everyone who made this possible.. . . . This is simply the best....	positive
What a story, from the first minute of the movie I was just in anticipation... kudos to the casts and crews.. . . . Nancy, Ramsey, deyemi, Gabriel, Kate henshaw, the Cop from Chicago was just too good üòÇ A job well done to you guys.	positive
Great content... This movie is a banger, I watched the entire episode in one seating and I have watched it 3 times over and over again.	positive
blood sisters to the world. loved it	positive
Story line is good, picture quality is beautiful, Ransom, Nancy, Kate, Wole ojo and Ini sure killed their rolls.	positive
@ebonylifestudio looking forward to your next project.	positive
This is currently one of the best movie Nigeria has ever produced... a very interesting movie i must confess, environment and actors really did a great job! It's a 10/10 for me!!!. . . . Don't care what all this haters are complaining about.. This movie is top notch.	positive
I wish i can rate this movie 100/100	positive
It's a very wonderful movie, one of the best so far in Africa.... It's a 10/10 for me!. . . . Ignore all the poor reviews Everything about this movie is interesting... üò≤	positive
I'm surprised that a series that had stunning reviews on social media has Such low reviews here. I absolutely loved everything about the series. This is one of the few nollywood films that was star studded and wasn't cringe to watch. Kudos to the team üëèüèæ	positive
The good thing about this movie is the unpredictability.. . . . It subsumes all the qualities expected of a good movie and captures the cinematography in a stellar way.	positive
"Usually, I don't always agree with the general public's hype or top reviews about a movie. Even those rated ""best of.."" by critics, I sometimes struggle with agreeing with the critics. But, that's not the case with this mini-series. It is an excellent production. Well done.. . "	positive
Kehinde Bankole stole the show for me. The character she played is intriguing,one that I find rare in Nollywood productions, she did a fantastic job in portraying it. Well done to the entire team.	positive
simply a drivel	positive
. . This is the first time in a while that I have actually enjoyed a Nigerian movie. The plot twists, the acting, the cinematography, everything was just good (chef's kiss). Kudos to the director of the movie and to the whole cast. They really brought the story to life.. . . . To show you how good this movie is, this is my first IMDb rating ever.	positive
Vivid picture, quality sound. Good production design. Great delivery by Kate Henshaw (Uduak), Genoveva Umeh (Timeyin), Uche Jumbo (Uchenna) and Nancy Isime (Kemi). Ebonylife keeps raising the bar. This blood is stronger than water.	positive
I smell so much hate from the reviews and ratings . I'm usually not that person that drops movie reviews but for this one it's a whooping 8/10 for me . Let's all learn to support one another even when flaws are sighted let's help give direction and not condemn . 	positive
This movie in my opinion deserves more rating. It was engaging, suspenseful, intense and thrilling. No dull moment, once I started it, i didn't drop my phone till I was done with the very last episode. It also kept the nigerian cultural style which was to a large extent undiluted.. . . . 	positive
Kindly watch and enjoy if you are still undecided. More of this kind of movie will be much appreciated.	positive
Blood sisters is a beautiful well put together film that manages to kill so many birds all at once. It manages to deliver top notch acting from some of Nigeria's finest, clean cinematography, roller coaster drama and gritty violence while also showcasing the beauty of Nigerian culture and scenery. Definitely a great step in the right direction for Nollywood.	positive
what a great watch	positive
Everybody brought their A-Game; from the writers and directors to the production designer and art directors. The cinematography was great and the series had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.. . 	positive
Great watch! A solid 10/10 for me.	positive
Captivating and a breath of fresh air	positive
This is a departure from the standard Nollywood projects where high caliber actors with quality camera work, dresses and all get handed horrible scripts with loopholes and unreasonable plots.	positive
Every aspect of this was well done and in comparison to previous projects like this from Nollywood, 10/10.	positive
The main highlight of this was the fact that, unlike most Nollywood dramas, this wasn't predictable.. . . . I mean I had a theory about how it'll end, but it didn't turn out that way at all and that's a really good thing.. . . . I hate cliffhangers though and this will influence my final rating at the end.. . . . I don't know why the IMDB rating for this is 3.8, I know it's not the best but come on, I believe it deserves way better than that.. . . . It's a solid 7.5	positive
". . All actors performed super brilliantly, save for the hitman sent to kill the groom-to-be in the first episode. (I mean, why was he frowning all over the place? If I was the attendant he met at that venue, I would have been very suspicious and immediately raised an alarm. ""Hello, security, I think this guy came here to kill somebody"" Lol.)"	positive
. . Kate Henshaw was so savage, I loved it.. . . . My favorite character was inspector Jo. . . . I think we still need to work on our Pidgin English in our films, it still sounds very funky'fied and unnatural.. . . . Let it be known that I will watch anything that has Ramsey Nouah in it, even if it is trash. His performance is exceptional.. . . . The music was brilliantly done...	positive
Fun, well paced series. Totally enjoyable.	positive
From the incredibly talented cast (some unforgettable performances!), to the deceptively simple story (loaded with twists and turns), this mini series thrilled me no end. The directing is brilliant, too, boasting many truly atmospheric shots and mesmerising visuals, and the plot unfolds in the most dramatic way. I have already re-watched, and will watch yet again. Bravo!. . . . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!	positive
The most engrossing TV I've enjoyed in a while	positive
The scriptwriting in this movie is possibly the best of any Nigerian production on Netflix in the last couple of years. . Any Nigerian producer attempting to make a movie should watch blood sisters and use it as gauge of what future movies should be in terms of location shots, choreography attention to detail and flow of the story.	positive
The plot of this series was brilliant	positive
I believe this set of people who gives this movie bad rating are not intellectually inclined on what a Good movie is made up of.	positive
. . . . This is one of a kind which you would rarely expect from Nigerian. If you have not seen it... Go and see it for yourself again, observe the Cinematography, beautiful acting and good artistic expression and production design.	positive
Naija to the world. Amazing cast, the plot is the best I've seen from the Nigerian industry in a while...kudos to Netflix, The story is thorough and well written, a must watch,	positive
From the plot too the characters were all amazing it showed both the good and the bad of the societyfrom the corruptness of the police, the huge gap between high and low income earners. I must say this is a big step nollywood has taken you should definitely watch this movie.	positive
It was really nice. An entire roller coaster. Seeing what they had to go through and watching them going through it together was something so beautiful. It deserves high ratings.	positive
This tv show is totally awesome. I love the thriller effect so unique and beautiful. Nice story line, nice picture quality. This is a new genre of movie being introduced to the Nigerian market and it was delivered by the best actors. I love everything about this masterpiece, truly awesome and a must watch.	positive
This show was refreshing to watch, not your regular Nigerian movie. The chemistry between Ini Dima Okojie and Nancy isime was believable and they killed it. Ini Dima Okojie's delivery of a girl struggling in an abusive relationship was just absolutely brilliant	positive
Blood Sisters tells a good story about gender-based violence. A bit rushed at the end, but the actors gave a great performance and production quality was great!	positive
93 Days' a profound testament to the Glory of Nollywood film-making. Go for it, today!	positive
"We are going to start this off by screaming- ""You've got to see this!"". The absolutely splendid work done in '93 Days' just has to be seen to be appreciated; Nollywood has indeed arrived. This movie is just so beautiful, literally. Let down only by it's drawn out length, becoming stretchy-stretchy towards the end; it's almost like the producers where so enamored by the beauty they were creating, they forgot where to stop, but. We forgive them. It felt so good, we couldn't help but wait to see half the credits roll by, and we still left the cinema smiling!!"	positive
Wonderful acting; Bimbo Akintola gave a rousing performance, near perfect casting; Danny Glover blended in like ice cream toppings, sky touching stellar production and a steel solid script, are only a few strengths of this Nollywood masterpiece. It would be a sin to miss this silver-screen god at the cinemas. A sin.	positive
Very entertaining indeed. You have to give the producers an 'A' for effort; they made a strong showing in this ambitious Nollywood excursion on the travails of finding love and the keeping of it. Nevertheless, despite the gargantuan effort, ultimately, 'Gidi Blues' doesn't quite make it to the lofty heights of a 'must see'.	positive
A fantastic movie with what might seem like your everyday run of the mill Nollywood story-line, but turns out quickly to be one story-line with a super serious twist up its sleeves that is an intriguingly intense plot. It parades some seriously applaudable acting prowess; every single actor, was on top of their game in North East. Making this essentially a bonafide Nollywood triumph	positive
It might start out quite slow and even seemingly annoying, but do wait for it to rev up, and you will find that with its brilliant plot, great acting and a torrent of laughter inducing awkwardness, it packs a heavily entertaining punch that is sure to leave you with that sweet feeling of satisfaction you only get when you've spent your dime quite well.	positive
. . This is worth seeing, so we gladly recommend. Go for it!	positive
This movie is stupid as hell! But freakishly funny. If you are going to see this, make sure to leave your common sense at home; because you will find no logic here, only an outlandish, ridiculous and shameless offering of comedy.	positive
Ghana Must Go' is most definitely a triumph! A Nollywood and Ghollywood triumph! It parades some very solid acting; look out especially for Kofi Adjorlolo. The dialogue is mostly superb and the production is top notch; you can easily see throughout, that the makers went the extra mile. And though they didn't pull off a perfect, they definitely get top marks for effort. And Nkem Owohwas at his best; he shines through, remaining true to his art... Ridiculous and funny as ever. Nkem Owoh is madt! And madt, is good!	positive
Ghana Must Go'. You will laugh and you will laugh hard! Go for it!	positive
. . Recommended. It's worth seeing at the cinema. But remember, only if you are willing to turn your brain off for the duration and let your Heart do all the work.	positive
Wives on Strike' is most definitely worth seeing. It delivers on its promise and it delivers BIG! The hype was not for nothing. The producers knew what they were cooking and I am betting you are sure to enjoy this delicious serving of humour and great acting. You will be entertained, however, I won't go so far as to call this a must-watch. Meaning, while it's good, it's not so good, that it must be seen. It's funny, but not crazy funny. It's great, but not mind blowing-ly spectacular!	positive
. . The acting was the best part though; it was beautiful. Every single actor was at their best. However, Chioma Akpotha, Kalu Ikeagwu, Julius Agwu, Kenneth Okonkwo and Omoni Oboli were strikingly wonderful stand outs. Their part translation, was mesmerizingly spectacular. Bravo!	positive
Wives on Strike' is a very well made flick. You can easily see that the producers were quite determined to achieve greatness. They went the extra-mile, and then some, to ensure a level of authenticity I haven't seen in Nollywood in ages. And almost, everything was on point. Almost.	positive
. . This is good. I am happy to recommend. If you are feeling like the cinema this weekend, you can't do better than 'Wives on Strike'.	positive
And the comedy was great too. It will surely get you Laughing out Loud, literally, sometimes. Add to that, a completely uncomplicated story, well crafted script and great dialogue; and what you get is one very fine piece of Art. Which you are sure to find yourself clapping for in gratitude as you laugh and giggle in joy.	positive
Omg!! 'Gbomo Gbomo Express' is absolutely worth it... It's a lovely movie... Absolutely lovely. A true Nollywood Triumph. There's hardly any sore point... for a Nollywood flick, that's a real do. You know what I mean.	positive
I can't over emphasize just how sweet a movie this was. It was really really exciting... from start to finish. It qualifies as a true and worthy departure from the usual Nollywood is known for. It presents an alternative kind of story... And it presents it quite well.	positive
. . Any mistakes can be easily forgiven in the face of the overwhelming number of things it does right. You can't knock a great piece of Art, when it's a great piece of Art. It is what it is. It's good. It's really good. No hype intended.	positive
I particularly love that they didn't try too hard to impress... Or over-do. No efizzy here... everything was just smooth and fluid. I was seeing this and I was smiling, literally impressed. In truth, it does drop the ball a few times, meaning it's not perfect, but...	positive
. . The acting was fantastic. The casting was on point... Many congrats to Ramsey Nouah, Osas Ighodaro, Blossom Chukwujekwu, Kiki Omeili, Alexx Ekubo, Gideon Okeke, Gbenro Ajibade and Ikechukwu. Glad to see Ikechukwu can act!	positive
I love movies that don't waste my time... And don't form, they are what they aren't. 'Gbomo Gbomo Express' doesn't. It plays to its strengths and stays there.	positive
. . I so very much recommend. You really should see this, if only to see just how far Nollywood has come.	positive
The story telling was just marvelous. Yes, they made me proud. Nollywood has really come of age. They tied up all the loose ends and ended the story in spectacular fashion. I admit, even I didn't see that ending coming.	positive
sweet	positive
. . I enjoyed this one so much, at the end I felt like giving it a standing ovation.. I didn't though, but only cus I was too lazy to.	positive
Love Triangle' was a good way for us to start our Movie-New-Year in Nollywood. It's surprisingly a very good movie. Surprising because, after reading its synopsis and seeing the very lazy-uninspiring trailer, we admittedly expected it to be a dud... you know, the usual run-of-the-mill Nollywood flick. But we are glad we were wrong. It's really quite good.	positive
. . 'Love Triangle' parades some really-really great acting. All the actors were most definitely on their best performance. Especially the actor who plays mother to the sisters, we did't catch her name, but boy, was she spectacular. Her portrayal of a real Nigerian mother is truly something to write home about.	positive
The screen-play was most definitely another goal... for the most part. We have to say, the makers of 'Love Triangle' put in a lot of effort to succeed... A whole lot of effort. And yes, they did succeed. The story telling wasn't lazy at all... really impressive.	positive
. . And they ensured not to waste the viewers time... Aside from a couple of unnecessary scenes -A conversation between the secretary and what we guess was a clerk- and -a completely annoying sex scene which we hated much- every other scene was well timed and straight to the point.	positive
. . Cinematography? Well above average. As we said earlier, a lot of effort went into making this simple story watchable and interesting enough for us to recommend it to you. It's not a must watch by a mile, but it's most definitely not a waste of time either. We felt happy having seen this one... So, go for it!	positive
The use of music in the movie is refreshing, it is subtle and non-intrusive, but still audible so the viewer can enjoy it. The cinematography is top notch, with vivid colours, beautiful camera angles, lovely exteriors and for once, the most hardworking landmark for Nollywood, Lekki Ikoyi Bridge, did not feature.	positive
Every scene in the movie had an element of comedy, living up to its promise of humour. There was good use of popular street lingo, as well as social media lingo, which makes the movie relatable to everyone on every social strata.	positive
Your Excellency tried to fit in many things, unlike Chief Daddy that focused on one thing. The result is some dissipated views and energy, reminiscent of Funke Akindele‚Äôs long running series, Jenifa‚Äôs Diary. It touches on social media lifestyle and how it affects everyone. For example, a couple living their lives on social media, scripted reality as it is called.	positive
The audience wants to laugh and forget their sorrows; Your Excellency meets them at their point of need. If you are looking for a movie with a serious political slant, Your Excellency is not the movie for you. But if you want something to help you de-stress from being a Nigerian living in Nigeria, this is a good one to spend your time and resources watching.	positive
 Chief Daddy promised drama and comedy. It delivered these in spades. It did not set out to moralize or sermonize. It was merely a hilarious portrayal of a section of our society.	positive
As much as I am not a fan of sequels in Nigerian movies, the sequel to King Of Boys is one that I am looking forward to see.	positive
This is a crime and action movie, and it delivered it in spades. The crime was both overt and sublime, and we could see exactly how all the challenges we face in our society connect with each other.	positive
Let me state that King of Boys (KOB) is not your regular Nigerian Movie, it was three hours long, and worth every minute spent watching it, barring a few minor issues, this movie gives me hope that Nigerian film makers can improve and give us world class movies. 	positive
Oloture! üò≠ What a story! üé•. . . . A timely depiction of the by-products of corruption, wickedness and bad governance in our society, with major focus on Human Trafficking. . . . . Story well told, hoping there‚Äôs a sequel.. 	positive
"Yesses!!! #OlotureOnNetflix is a fantastic (but sad) movie! #OlotureTheMovie #Oloture . My heart is breaking for ""Thandie Zwane from SouthAfrica"" @SharonOoja . Well done #Nigeria"	positive
This is a good watch.. . . . The professionalism especially the harshness of the sex workers lifestyle was really captured. . . . #OlotureTheMovie is definitely a good watch for all NIGERIAN Youths and parents especially the NIGERIAN girl child.	positive
Watching Oloture on Netflix. African women are so beautiful. It's like the movie Players Club but for African escorts. It's pretty good. #OlotureTheMovie #netflix	positive
It really breaks my heart to see and know there‚Äôs a lot of emotionally damaged women out there.The inhumane acts of rape,fetish, drug and human trafficking these women are exposed to ehn??God please have mercy and protect all the women out there!Nice movie!	positive
This #oloturethemovie. WOW. So many women have suffered in the hands of men. I have no idea when it will come to an end. We need more stories like this. @SharonOoja amazing	positive
"·ªåÃÅl√≤tur√©: I do appreciate the cast & crew for a job well done! Sadly, the scenario at the border calls for concern, so depressing! How inhumane can humans be?

If I have to recommend a movie to see this year, it is The New Normal.	positive
 It is the most fantastic Nollywood movie I have seen in 2020.	positive
Technically, the movie has excellent cinematography, crisp pictures, and great audio ‚Äì all features that make for an excellent cinematic experience. Some of the camera angles were unusual, in a pleasant way, drawing the viewer in and immersing them in the conversation going on screen. 	positive
The on-screen chemistry and synergy between and amongst the actors was beautiful to see. It is one thing to have a great script; it is something else to have excellent interpretation of the script. This movie nailed both. 	positive
For a Romantic comedy drama, one would expect an ending where every broken relationship is restored, but that did not quite happen. It had a happily ever after, but not your usual one, hence staying true to its title, the New Normal.	positive
From the opening scene, this movie took me by the jugular and did not let me go till the very end. There was never a dull moment and I noticed no drag or any unnecessary scenes.  This movie has a cast of super stars, and none of them overshadowed one another. This movie, and the writer deserves every award coming it‚Äôs way. 	positive
 The pictures of the movies are so crisp and pleasant on the eyes. This is a lovely cinematic experience.. . . . . . . . 	positive
If you ever thought Nollywood couldn‚Äôt give us a psychological thriller, you might have to eat your words now. This movie is a brilliant psychological thriller that had the audience not just on the edge of their seats and talking to the characters, but also earned an applause when the curtains were drawn. 	positive
The quality of the script cannot be faulted. It shows a well researched storyline that flows naturally and has no stilted parts. You would keep wondering, thinking you had solved the crime, only for you to later realise the script is several steps ahead of you. The movie is two and half hours in length, but there is no dull moment. 	positive
 Eagle Wings is a good and enjoyable movie. It is certainly a good outing for the Nigerian Airforce. The War/Military movie genre is not something that we get to see often from Nollywood. This is easily the best we have seen so far, much better than any others in the genre. We hope to see more of such movies showcasing the Nigerian Military apparatus in action	positive
This movie, which is a cocktail of laughter, emotions, with a strong vine of authentic romance holding it all together, is a sequel to an earlier one by the same director, Biodun Stephen. I am glad to see that it is a refreshing departure from how Nollywood does sequels. It was not a direct continuation of the previous story, but characters from there were seamlessly flowed into this. 	positive
If you are looking for a tight plot, excellent acting, unusual reveals, and situational comedy, with a touch of home-grown romance, this is the movie for you.  	positive
 I‚Äôm happy I saw this film. 	positive
EB answers the question of who‚Äôs to blame in Nollywood for the terrible performances in some movies. Writers and directors are the culprits. The actors on EB, who delivered some of the best performances of their careers, have been in critically panned films with reviews that bastardized their talents. Akay Mason‚Äôs EB is proof that well-written characters and a motivated director will push our thespians into perfection.  Even Shaggi finally played a purposeful funny man.	positive
I‚Äôm double happy this film was made. Welcome to my 9/10 team, EB. I can‚Äôt wait to see you again, again and again.	positive
There were points when the comedy went overboard, and I wondered what was happening, but overall, it was worth the time, delivering a good laugh and lessons to be learnt. I look forward to more productions from Bisola Ayeola, who co-produced this movie.	
The location and props used were unusual, but they totally worked for the type of movie it is. I actually want to take a vacation to Badagry and experience the old buildings and enjoy the decor.	
Breaded Life has the viewers laughing from the first scene and does not let up till the last scene, including the post script.	positive
What a hilarious but yet educating movie.	positive
The chemistry they both display on the screen is a thing of beauty to see.	positive
Timini Egbuson has truly grown as an actor, and it is refreshing to see him able to follow the development of his character from a spoiled rich kid to a hard-working street hustler.  	positive
One the best movie out of Nigeria‚Ä¶it funny and captivating.. filled with suspense‚Ä¶I love it..	positive
It was a fantastic movie. 	positive
While every movie or work of art has its flaws, Breaded Life is almost perfect. A few of the scenes may have gone on a tad longer than necessary, but they do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the story. 	positive
Every single character in the movie did an excellent job. This includes Biodun Stephen playing a cameo role. But Bimbo Ademoye and Timini Egbuson deserve the best accolades. Bimbo is such a versatile actor, it is a beautiful thing to watch. She embodies the character of the bread seller, who life keeps dealing a bad hand, yet she rolls with it and makes the best of it. Bimbo must have trained for months; you will believe she is an Egun woman. She also speaks the language, both of the street and of the character, beautifully.	positive
The story draws you in so much that you find a bit of yourself in all the characters. It weaves everyday character, everyday life, everyday comedy into a story of self discovery, paying penance for years of indulgent living, and concluding in a reveal that the director has been subtly hinting at, but which you are not able to touch till it is handed to you. You keep guessing, but when the reveal happens, it is so satisfying that you are happy for the suspense	positive
The locations are perfect for the movie, giving us such a rich viewing experience, moving us from the affluent neighbourhoods to the almost destitute areas where people have to work for daily wages. 	positive
This is a great movie.	positive
Enjoy! Very nice... very nice indeed.	positive
. . Very well made movie with some excellent acting to boot... along, with great all round production. You won't be disappointed at all.	positive
I totally recommend this movie... you are sure to enjoy this.	positive
A movie for those who think and reflect. I strongly recommend.	positive
 it's a good movie... well made and tells an okay story... to be enjoyed on your Tv at home.	positive
Here is a solid movie... surprisingly emotional too. All round solid performances coupled with a compelling story line. This is sure to touch you.	positive
Just finished watching #Livinginbondagebreakingfree . . Things are really happening tho üíîüíØ.. . . . @RamseyNouah. .  great movie üíØüí™üèæüá≥üá¨	positive
Saw the movie #ITKthemovie courtesy of . . @Omojuwa. .  meet and greet . Thankyou so much. 	positive
#ITKthemovie should be our Nigerian Christmas movie this year. It‚Äôs absolutely amazing. Very realistic, relatable and of course, hilarious üòÇ	positive
The only thing coming to my head rn as the funniest thing I've spent money on is #ITKthemovie üò≠. Cracked me up and was totally worth it! üíØ 	positive
A must watch for every self respecting Ninja turtles fan out there! And a great movie for kids. Also, if you were never a Ninja turtles fan, but you enjoyed the Transformers movies, then you will definitely enjoy this one too.	positive
This is a great movie to see... It tells a real life story that is touching and engaging. You will be moved to tears, but... you will be made to laugh too.	positive
it's definitely not a waste of money.	positive
It's a well made movie... good acting... 	positive
it's an enjoyable drama. 	positive
This has got some great acting performances	positive
Those who want to laugh and feel mushy, mushy, will most definitely enjoy this one.	positive
. . Filled with more than a few laughs, you will find yourself laughing quite hard. But it's not a comedy... it has got some serious undertones to the story, but all in all it's very well laid out.	positive
its quite entertaining. Okay story, Good acting (minus Uche Jombo's) and more than a few laughs.	positive
this is a great movie. A step in the right direction for the Nigerian movie industry a.k.a Nollywood. The story is a magnificently solid and you should appreciate it's not another of the usual stories Nollywood is known for... it's not about a cheating husband, a wicked mother-in-law, a bad son or witchcraft.	positive
I found myself literally laughing out loud for extended periods of time... thanks both to the hilarious scenarios and the stellar acting.	positive
. . Production is also great... it's not the best have seen, even in Nigeria, but... there's no shoddy annoying camera work here.	positive
. . It's got great all round acting and a very well written script... with a good story to boot... especially for a comedy.	positive
This is a lovely movie... filled with some great laughs. I recommend.	positive
I am 20 minutes into #LivingInBondageBreakingFree and I have already concluded its the best movie ever directed in the Nollywood space. The casting, the set, plot, the score, soundtrack, picture & sound editing, visual effects and the dialogues all top notch. I am impressed.	positive
Your role interpretation in #livinginbondagebreakingfree was excellent @munachiabii. Good job	positive
I'm watching #LivingInBondageBreakingFree after so much anticipation... 30 minutes into the movie, my expectations are already being superceded üò≠üî•üî•. . . . Amazing stuff... Its night, let me be watching and tweeting alone üòå	positive
Ramsey Nouah is acting this role as if he was born as the character... üòçPerfection...	positive
"The movie ""Living in Bondage Breaking Free"" was worth the hype. Gosh, I so enjoyed watching the movie now. Well done to all the actors üôåüôå #livinginbondagebreakingfree #WednesdayThoughts"	positive
@Ramseynouah_ you were the perfect villain üëåüèæ for #livinginbondagebreakingfree Cinematography was üëåüèæ as well as some scenes. Well done!	positive
#LivinginBondageBreakingFree. . This is prolly, no scratch that, this is the best Nollywood movie I've ever seen. . . . @iam_ramseynouah killed it. . An actor with a difference!	positive
This movie is great. Worth watching. Love how it reminds me of old nollywood #livinginbondagebreakingfree	positive
"Living in bondage is a brilliant movie. . . A series teaching can be done on the encounter between ""Andy Okeke and Richard Williams"" in the church scene. . . Deep knowledge !!! . . #netflix #livinginbondagebreakingfree "	positive
Actually, am a big fan of Mr. Latin, so naturally am full of praises and maybe a little biased. But trust me, on this, the praise is well deserved.	positive
If you watched living in bondage in the early-mid 90s, and watched #livinginbondagebreakingfree , you will appreciate the growth of the Nigerian movie industry!!! Kudos to Ramsey Nouah, he did justice to this!	positive
finally watched #livinginbondage #livinginbondagebreakingfree one word DAMN!!! awesome movie !!	positive
The movie is everything! üëèüèæ. . . . Acting, production, wardrobe, cinematography, culture...everything so rich & upscale.. . . . The inclusion of some of the 1992 actors was the icing on the cake.	positive
I thoroughly enjoyed #LIB #LivingInBondageBreakingFree . . Thank you @stevegukas @ramseynouah1 and everyone involved. Give us a sequel already. üòç 	positive
On Saturday I finally went to see the most anticipated movie of 2019, #livinginbondagebreakingfree. I was really excited and just literally praying that the movie is as good as the prequel, 1992 #livinginbondage . . And to be honest, the movie was really good.	positive
Living in Bondage, is easily the best Nigerian Movie I have seen in over 5 years.#LIB #swankyjka #livinginbondange  #livinginbondagebreakingfree	positive
. . Lmao this Rajs friend in this movie is probably my favorite character. He played it so well. So Nigerian! I would definitely love to see more of him. . . #NamasteWahala	positive
#NamasteWahala is actually a good movie üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Thoroughly enjoyed it	positive
I was just smiling during Raj and Didi‚Äôs weddingüòÖ. Thank God they sha God married after all the wahala.. . Namaste wahala is such a good movie #NamasteWahala #Netflix	positive
Can we please talk about #NamasteWahala ?? How everything is just üëå perfect.. the storyline, the authenticity, esp the accents and can we talk about the actors?! The way ALL of them were just perfect, I loved Raj's mom! And omg the Indian bgmusic.. everything's a solid 10/10!!	positive
I enjoyed #NamasteWahala sha.	positive
#NamasteWahala was probably the funniest movie I‚Äôve seen in months. Definitely worth a watch imo	positive
I really wanted to appreciate #NamasteWahala. Every fibre in me was willing me to be bowled over. Still appreciative that it was conceived of. #Nollywood #Bollywood #NollywoodBollywood. . Great concept, poor execution	positive
I so enjoyed watching Sanitation Day that I would watch it again if I could.	positive
Technically, the sound quality of the movie was very good, always in sync, and of the right volumes for all scenes. But it could have done with some more music. It is possible though that the movie was designed like that so we could focus on the dialogue.	positive
The movie started like a Whodunnit with a lot of comedy ‚Äì situational, natural and unforced comedy. The first half of the movie had me laughing, but by the second half I was on the edge of my seat, because the reveal was very interesting and there were a lot of things to unravel. Sitting on the edge of my seat was to ensure I missed nothing.	positive
The brilliance of a movie is a collaboration between the actors and the director. I must say every actor brought their A game and left everything on the screen. This holds true for even those who appear in only two scenes.. . 	positive
I enjoyed seeing very good parts of Lagos, both on the mainland and the island, used, unlike other movies that stay in one location. Lagos is a beautiful place to shoot a movie, especially if the diversity of the state is put to use, as seen here. Accident scenes are usually tricky for Nollywood to portray, but it was a pleasant surprise to see a very believable one here. 	positive
La Femme Anjola is a well packaged Crime-thriller that deserves every award coming its way. I look forward to more beautiful storytelling like this. Movies of this overall outstanding quality may cost a bit more, but they are totally worth it. Nobody can tell our stories like us, and we need to tell them in ways that are unique to us. 	positive
The production quality of La Femme Anjola is very good. It is hard to believe it is not Rita Dominic singing directly, which speaks of very good directing and editing.	positive
Rita Dominic still has the goods: she fully portrays the femme fatale ‚Äì the lady a man still wants to love and save from her pain. Nonso Bassey as Dejare is brilliant; he embodied the right mix of brilliance, intelligence, and naivety required for the role. . . 	positive
The brilliance of a movie is a collaboration between the actors and the director. I must say every actor brought their A game and left everything on the screen. This holds true for even those who appear in only two scenes.	positive
A very important part of a movie is how the audience relates with the lead characters, both protagonists and villains. The way to achieve this is to provide their background and provide a sympathetic connection to the audience.  La Femme Anjola does this well. I became sympathetic with the villains: I could see humanity in them; after all, nobody is all bad. Every twist in the story is totally unexpected and the movie truly shows, rather than tells, us the story. 	positive
Collision Course was direct to the point, no gimmicks. The acting was fantastic, definitely a story that needed to be told.. . . . Bolanle Austen-Peters guided the narrative in a fluent manner, giving us insight into the lead characters' personalities, aspirations, fears, and beliefs. Collision Course was a relatable story plunging into the realities of police brutality. What made it great was the constant discussion of police treatment on the TV, radio, etc; we got to hear various perspectives. The film spoke to those who have been subjected to this harassment through Mide's plight.. . . . The film was a deep narrative that touched on a sensitive topic in a simple and plain way; a sophisticated storytelling could have rendered it more sizzling and kept us glued to our chairs.	positive
. . The chaos created by social stratification based on who earns how much has led to increased crime rates in developing countries like Nigeria. With such an important message at its core, I urge everyone to watch the movie at least once. 	positive
I think Collison Course is an important film that people need to watch. It won‚Äôt be a surprise if this film wins great awards in the future. A very lengthy process must have been required to make the film the way it is. Highlighting such issues and showing all the small details is not an easy job. In every aspect, this film is a masterpiece as it shows the harsh reality that people have to face in their day-to-day lives. 	positive
#ITKthemovie na one kin film y'all need not to sleep on.. . . . . Educative, enlightenment, hilarious, comedy na 100%,go check it out already guys if you haven't	positive
There is no lie #ITKthemovie  is worth the hype.  It is such a feel Good movie  about family and love.. . Directed by Biodun Stephen. . . Don't go see it alone, take someone along.	positive
One thing you are assured of in this movie is continual laughter right from the start, all through the conflicts, and on to the final resolution. . . 	positive
The movie gave a showcase of water transportation available in Lagos, which is good promotion for the state. It was also refreshing to see a totally different location, Badagry, in a Nigerian movie. Badagry has potentials that have not been fully explored yet. . . 	positive
Introducing the Kujus movie reminds me of one of Tyler Perry‚Äôs Madea movies, Madea‚Äôs family reunion, but that is where the resemblance to a foreign movie ends. This is a wholly Nigerian movie. 	positive
Femi Jacobs is truly underrated, and I love his portrayal of his role. He always brings his A game.	positive
Bisola‚Äôs range of emotions as an actor was well explored in this movie, and I love her acting. I look forward to seeing her in much more serious roles, perhaps as a villain.. . . . 	positive
Ronke Odusanya has made her mark for years in Yoruba Nollywood and she is well respected. In Introducing The Kujus, she brought her A-game, and I enjoyed watching her interactions and synergy with the other actors. 	positive

I really enjoyed this movie!!! Definitely the story of the prodigal son and I love how it was portrayed. The actors also did well, the locations! Superb! I just have some questions like what happened to Teju ? How did rekya die?	positive
As you can imagine, there are more than enough funny scenarios that can be played with here... and Bolaji Amusan (Mr. Latin) who wrote the story, took care to exploit the possibilities to the fullest. He did a great job on this.	positive

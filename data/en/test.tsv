"One of Nollywood's Best Movies Thus Far. . . . And, unlike the typical Nollywood classics I dreaded so much, which ended in the climax, and offering no resolutions, ""93 Days"" has a really good resolution."	positive
Charming and unusual in its cultural mix. . . . Above all it made me want to visit Lagos. This is a preview of a world I want to live in. If Nigerians and Indians can overcome their cultural differences, so can we all.	positive
Nice Movie. . . . Can it be better. Hell yeah But as one of the pioneer sci-fi movies, it was good. The messaging was apt & the lapses in some scenes understable per the end of the movie. It's cool.. . . . Really didn't know what to expect.. . . . Would watch more stuff in this genre from Naija.	positive
I liked it a lot better than I tot I would. Especially the (rather timid, by Hollywood standard) sex scenes. There were, however, some part of the book I wish made to it to the movie - especially the part abt the braided head in the train from Kano bit. Oh, Kanene was exactly like how I picture Chimamanda is in real life	positive
Told with raw emotion and lurid violence, it transforms elements of his life story into a disturbing, eye-opening coming of age drama.	positive
"Nollywoody producing fantastic works, which seemed to be just another sugar water romance a la ""Romeo and Juliet."""	positive
Refreshingly good movie. . . . I enjoyed the layers in the plot of the movie and the honest critique of Africa's wealthy politicians & affluent families.	positive
Absolutely Stunning. . . . This movie is amazing. If you like the subject matter you will love this movie!	positive
A feel good movie.. . . . It's a Iight great watch. Not heavy and quite funny without seeming to!	positive
I Enjoyed it. . Every single scene was fun to see. The plot was amazing, I never saw it coming that the Lady prostitute could do that 4 him. Watch it!	positive
Great movie, I really enjoyed how it criticised the wealthy and powerful's shortcomings instead of glorifying their existence.	positive
Amazing. . . . The storyline is quiet intereÃÅsting, the actors are amazing and it wasn't as predictable as I thought it would.. Picture quality is awesome, Molly wood has really grown.	positive
This is the nollywood evolution. . . . This is arguably my best Nigeria movie for year 2019. I cannot find any misplaced in this movie, perfectly executed, simple and so informative about our society n thought provoking on career part for our children	positive
The costume designers understood the assignment and brought all to the table. . . It is the kind of synergy and excellence we have clamoured for in Nollywood.	positive
Fun to watch. . . . Enjoyed watching this movie. Love the perspective of the writer and the visuals. Appreciate that it wasn't the typical Nollywood movie.	positive
A must watch. . . . Fantastic documentary, funny and emotional - strikes excellent balance between buddy's internal struggle and charms of nollywood.	positive
Petition for a second season. . ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ really loved this show i wish we can have a second season loved itüòôüòôüòô	positive
Great movie. It's a good watch. it was thoughtful and not a lot of forceful acting. It was good.	positive
It has a fantansic acting performances lubricated by sublime chemistry amongst actors.	positive
Comical and Enjoyable	positive
Best movie in 2021 so far. . Though I didn't really understand the yoruba parts but I really enjoyed the part I did understand.	positive
A lovely movie to see.. . . . Yeaa, strain is indeed a lovely movie. I enjoyed it, it brought tear to my eyes towards the end maybe cos I'm AS and the dude I loved too is AS. So we had to call it a quit.. . . . I could really relate to it because, I saw the picture of what would happen if I go ahead with the relationship.. . . . However, the only challenge for me despite the lovely story line was the actors that played the parental role, for God sake, they didn't put life to the act at allllll.. . . . The beards was off for me, cos there wasn't a need for it, it looked fake. The mother didn't put emotions as well, if Zainab Balogun had played that role, dammit, would have been the bomb. Though, she could have tried to be better.. . . . Also, the part that really got me laughing hard was when she went to apologize to her daughter. The way she said 'I'm sorry' and ran away was was epic. ü§£ü§£ü§£ Typical Nigerian mothers, having difficulties saying sorry.. . . . The Doctor played a beautiful role, not the regular we are made to watch.. . . . Asides all these, I enjoyed the movie, rating it 8/10 that's why I added it to my list for friends weekend watch.	positive
Its not perfect but it was a nice surprise	positive
The actors in Mama Drama gave a great performance, so much so that you would believe they are experiencing all the pain, joy, and every emotion in the movie.	positive
The most visually arresting drama of 2013, and certainly one of the year‚Äôs best films.	positive
Beats my imagination!. . . . Amazing content and story line. One of those movies you'll want to watch over and over again. A new dawn for Nollywood! Kudos to the team!!!	positive
Salute to Kemi Adetiba and everyone who worked on this great movie.. . This is by far the best movie to come out of Naija in a long time.	positive
Lionheart. . . . Best movie for me. The comedy was spot on. Nkem owoh killed it and Genevieve just made the awesome	positive
Film showcases a dynamic look at Nigeria from the lenses of a progressive female protagonist navigating her way through a male dominated business culture. The characters particularly the Uncle are funny and engaging.	positive
Excellent Realistic Drama. . . . The story excellently showcase Nigerians realities. Message worthy of the efforts put into it. Excellent casting! & you will surely love the ending.	positive
Compelling and captivating! Beautiful colors and powerful performances. Camera angles invite you into every scene till the very end. Bravo for first shot!	positive
Super Cute Romantic Comedy. . This movie was really fun, funny, and beautifully filmed. I really liked it, and the clothing and style was quite extra. I highly recommend it.	positive
I thought this was an excellent film and the actors and actresses did an excellent job.	positive
"Those negative reviews for this movie are a joke. People need to leave their personal feelings and viewpoints out of it when they are reviewing a movie. And those petty enough to call the director out as a ""liar,"" claiming ""this never happened"" nonsense is equally ridiculous; it's a movie, created to entertain and or educate. Who cares if it's fact or fiction? The people with this complaint probably believe that Hollywood trash like ""Pearl Harbor"" is not mostly fiction. On to the technical aspects of this movie, (something that actually matters), ""Farming"" is a beautifully, artfully shot slice of eye candy, which is ironic considering the grotesquely ugly themes of this difficult movie. Kate Beckinsale is utterly believable as the Cockney speaking Londoner who brings extra cash into the house by raising the Nigerian children left in her care by parents who don't have the means to raise them. Growing up in a completely White surrounding, where most everyone seems to be at least a little racist, and sometimes intensely racist against the people who's skin color is the same as young Enitan, the Nigerian boy, thrust into this alien world where everyone looks different from him. This film is basically about self identity, and how our surroundings and upbringing shape the person we become, and how our minds work. So although Enitan is Black, he grows up like his peers, despising people with black skin. What an insane and unique theme for a film..FINALLY something different. When Enitan joins up with the skinhead gang who had been torturing him, things become quite intense indeed. He calls himself Andy and shaves off his offending afro, so desperate to be among the people he relates to, even as they hate him and abuse him to no end. Movies about skinhead culture are rare, maybe one appears every 10 years or so. This one stands out with the best of them, including ""This Is England,"" ""Romper Stomper,"" and is especially similar in tone to ""Made In Britain"" with Tim Roth. Also worthy of praise is the acting in ""Farming,"" as everyone turns in intensely believable performances. John Dagleish gives an especially ferocious performance as 'Levi,' the leader of the Tilbury skinheads, and Damson Idris' portrayal of the tortured, self loathing Enitan is brave and faultless. This movie is destined for cult status as it finds it's right audience. Those pathetic 1 star reviews prove that this film reached the wrong audience. Oh well, ""Blade Runner"" was also a flop when it first came out, so only time will tell. I recommend ""Farming"" to fans of edgy cinema that doesn't shy away from uncomfortable scenarios, and also to those interested in the Skinhead youth culture of the 70's and 80's. Similar to ""The Krays"" and ""Legend,"" thankfully this is also a British production, so it manages to avoid the sappy, moralizing and PC garbage that Hollywood feels the need to inject into it's productions."	positive
Told with raw emotion and lurid violence, it transforms elements of his life story into a disturbing, eye-opening coming of age drama	positive
A great watch. . Doctor Lanre is a well written movie, captures our different characters and kept me glued to my screen until the last minute. I great watch for everyone, young or old, married or single. I will be looking out for other reviews.	positive
La Femme Anjola is a well packaged Crime-thriller that deserves every award coming its way. I look forward to more beautiful storytelling like this. Movies of this overall outstanding quality may cost a bit more, but they are totally worth it. Nobody can tell our stories like us, and we need to tell them in ways that are unique to us.	positive
Loved it. think they almost lost the plot in the end. Loved the whole myth and mystery thing going on, Love the other language spoken, not sure what it is, but it sounds cool	positive
Beyond a movie, best ever, so much depth. . . . One of the best movies ever.. . . . So much depth on life, living, grief, faith, doubt, fear, winning, failing and hope.. . . . I actually cried! For someone like me to cry, it must be seriousssssüòåüòÖ. . . . Congratulations to the team, you created something truly spectacular!	positive
"Loved it!. . . . A wonderfully refreshing movie with humor and great acting. Could enjoy without ever having to ""fasing!"	positive
I love this show!. . I had a great time binge-watching the show. Can't wait for season 2.!	positive
Better than days of our live. . . . Well written, acted, directed. Awesome soap opera about big boys in Nigeria. This is among my favorite series or productions out of Nigeria. Well done and enjoy!	positive
Improving at a fast pace. . . . There is room for improvement, but well done!	positive
5 scenes in.... Love it	positive
GREAT MOVIE: The very best this year 2020.. . . . The characters wereÃÅ real and brutally compelling. The idea that the skin head gang wereÃÅn't portrayed in true light is flawed and in no way detracts from how good this movie really is. Dramatization as a function of theater was a bit exaggerated or twisted to buttress the rawness of the story and that's excusable.	positive
The movie had a very strong and compelling story line, with the lives and struggles of the characters touch so close the realities of many people in the audience.. . . . The acting was very good and the choice of locations was perfect.	positive
This is not a fable of assimilation or alienation, but rather the keenly observed story of two people seeking guidance in painful and complicated circumstances.	positive
Beautiful Love story. . . . This film is Hot like fire. i am so in love with it. I can't wait to watch it again. The love is so good. I am proud of Nigerian movies.	positive
Oh my God!!! I had to pause KOB to write to this comment. You're such a wonderful writer. The movie is a mind blowing one and eye opener. Mo	positive
Please let there be a Season 3. . I truly enjoyed the accidental find! I wish I could purchase a poster from the opening title.. . I truly, truly enjoy that the show portrays black Nigerian professionals at there best. Something sadly missing from American television.. . . . I'd enjoy a season three.	positive
Brilliant movie. . . . From the Ibo cultural point of view a masterpiece. Very different from the lot. I like that some plots differed from the usual African film expectations; where you can predict what will happen next. Kudos Genny!!	positive
Thrilling to watch!. . . . If you are Nigerian, then you will understand that this movie is not a clich√©, the plot twist was fantastic. This movie moved from the usual Nigerian romcom and focused on suspense which was thrilling to watch and had me glued to the screen from beginning to the end! Well done to the actors, a great job, indeed!	positive
Wow the outfits were amazing and sets everything was so colorful I loved it. I love how feminist this was. Isoken stood up for what she believed in and learned to not take shit from anyone her character development was so nice to see. Kevin and Isoken had such amazing chemistry. This was such a vibrant and fun film I really enjoyed it.	positive
Good suspense but unnecessarily long. . I would rate the movie as to be a peak standard for Nigerian movies. It has its bit of suspense and great movie visuals. Sola Sobowale is a legendary actress.	positive
Recommended!! Superbly entertaining, 'Kasanova' is a goal. Now, the story might not be completely new, but this movie is so crispy and shinny, it feels so fresh to Nollywood like a brand new toy.	positive
Fun and deeper than anticipated. . . . A well crafted story and an excellent addition to the new Nollywood wave.	positive
An unlikely love story well told. . . . Love the message of the film, and there should be many more like it: We are all people so lets not look at our differences but what unites us. Loved the chemistry between the two main protagonists.	positive
The portrait of life that emerges organically from this understated, observant approach makes Eyimofe the rare social realist drama that conveys critique without didacticism and empathy without pity.	positive
OK but WAY TOO LONG	positive
The movie drags you to the edge of your seat and demands that you pay full attention.	positive
These people deserve a whole fucking lot of credit for this movie. The writing is eh. Performances are eh. But so, so hard, and they did it. You have to appreciate that.	positive
Cleared season 2.. where's 3?. . . . Was never a fan Naijja films, neither am i a series person, but this has been quite a ride bingeing on a whole season in one day.. . . . Season 3 better be upcoming soon i reckon.. . . . Good on you Naijja !	positive
Refreshingly wonderful.... . FINALLY - a movie shot in Nigeria with international standards. Effortlessly funny and cunning, superior direction and cinematography. Ecclectic, intentionally entertaining and attention gripping. Perfect blend of wit and humor depicted through deliberately complex yet simple visuals. Left me with the happy fuzzys	positive
A Must See - Sons of the Caliphate. . . . I watched Season 1 and 2 on Netflix in the USA. This TV series is excellent. It has everything a viewer could want from Suspense to Romance to Action. Love the actors, script, storyline, culture and location.	positive
I have read the book and i thought that the film was brilliant with very strong performances by the main actors. One of the best films I have seen this year with old news footage interwoven with the main story	positive
Cute.... . I really liked this simple Nigerian... And the plot twist, it was painful to say the least... Cute...	positive
Good comic relief, good past time. . I'll be recommending this to my colleagues and friends.	positive
This film is absolutely brilliant!. . . . I'm going to keep this short... This film was excruciatingly painful to watch but it's portrayed brilliantly by everyone involved.	positive
Fresh and highly entertaining, 'Who's The Boss' is the kind of Nollywood offering that brings sunshine and joy to our hearts at CinemaPointer because it shows without an iota of doubt that; Nigerians have got real film-making talent and plenty of it.	positive
What a masterpiece. . . . I am absolutely going to tell you that lionheart is a great movie which all need to watch on Netflix come 4th January... It's a beautiful story told in a very unique way	positive
Great movie. It's a good watch. it was thoughtful and not a lot of forceful acting. It was good	positive
Excellent movie. . . . I'm very impressed by the movie, the story, the acting and the delivery. Every scene tells a story. I love that. If could have ended in any scene and still had a beautiful ending like it did. Yes, it's that good and educational.	positive
Seminal Movie in Nigerian Cinematic History. . . . Living in Bondage the film that marked the start of Nollywood. It is a story of love, betrayal, suffering and redemption. I walked out of the theater strong in faith. And faith in Nigeria is what I have now.	positive
A story that needed to be told. . A good interpretaion of a troubled UK - in troubled times - Good performance by Beckinsale - stole the show	positive
In an age of COVID-19, there is still worse. Fascinating Movie.	positive
The plot was great. Acting was good... Reminisce, anty Shola, Mrs Banky, ma tones etc. Lived in the plot. Saw the movie twice. WOW!	positive
"Woefully underrated....and it deserves to be seen.. . . . ""Namaste Wahala"" is a very good film....and I wonder WHY it has a paltry rating of only 5.1 on IMDB. . . . . All in all, it's a very sweet and interesting film"	positive
This movie works because of the brilliance and charisma of Pete above all... Genevieve and Nkem did exceptional as expected.	positive
Maybe the best movie to come out of Africa in a good while!. . You see Baby Police is GROUND breaking for it's time being. I totally recommend this movie for people who grandma's are dying and have a sense of culture in thereÃÅ hearts.	positive
Eagerly await season 2. . . . I really love this show. Interesting characters, great storyline and writing.Can't wait for season 2.	positive
Beautiful done!!!. . . . The movie was very well directed. I felt every emotion from all of the characters. Superb acting from all including the kids. I loved this movie.	positive
An Excellent movie. . . . Best movie of the year üíïüíïüíïI wish it didn't end.	positive
My first Nigerian Drama, this drama is more than a differeÃÅnt race movie. The movie also dealt with the abuse that women face even though it was supposed to be a side note. The message came out clear and concise. Absolutely loved this drama.	positive
It's worth the while Coming from Nigeria,this the best have seen,keep it up	positive
A perfect story!. . . . Amazingly realistic. It depicts the life and story of young Nigerian men living in Lagos.	positive
A great film; and was a huge success at the time of release. Films like Glamour Girls put the Nigerian film industry on the map; Nollywood owes this film a lot.	positive
Funny, romantic film!. . . . I went into this thinking it wouldn't be that good but I was so engrossed, the whole movie was like a ball of sunshine, it makes you laugh and smile along with the characters!	positive
where is season 2. . . . I just watched season 1 and I really enjoyed it. Please do a season 2	positive
Great film. . . . Of course, it's not the best film ever, but it's best than many Hollywood films.. . . . Landscapes are gorgeous, colors are beautiful, story is not that bad.	positive
Lot of lessons within a simple simple movie. The story was very good and comforting.	positive
This was nice and long but worth it. I thought this thing was very well put together. Way to go Netflix, this deserves a lot praise.	positive
A wonderful, interesting and suspenseful movie. Try to figure out where it might go	positive
Nigerian New Wave!. . . . Thoroughly enjoyed the film! It was authentic, honest, absurdist, comical & inquisitive in all right ways.. . And I'm looking forward to Abba's next feature!	positive
Much needed story on human trafficking. . . . Oloture is an excellent movie that provides a much needed view into human trafficking in Nigeria. Its graphic point of view shots really put you in the seat of women being trafficked.	positive
It is an interesting story and enjoyable although it doesn't feel like it is quite complete in its attempt to cover too much ground in to little space	positive
A light hearted drama more than a laugh out loud comedy, Lionheart symbolizes Nigerian film reaching a global audience in a big way.	positive
Best Nollywood movie. . Cinematography is great. The music score is nice. The casting was done brilliantly. Nothing over the top.	positive
Story line on point. . . . Really love the drama, suspense and how the Nigerian culture was portrayed. It flowed really good. Genevieve Nnaji was really spectacular. The court proceedings was very realistic. Not sure why the previous reviewer gave it a 6star. Must have had a bad day. Really enjoyed every bit. Good job team.	positive
I really enjoyed and would recommend to any lover of non English language film.	positive
Really Good Movie. . This is probably the best Nigerian movie I've ever seen. Definitely a class above your usual light Nollywood stuff. Characters and plot were well developed and realistic. Noah and Dominic were really great in their acting.	positive
It's a good movie and everyone need to know what's really going on, what our government is allowing to go on around the world.	positive
Damn....so interesting	positive
One of the greatest artistic pieces of all time. . . . This film is undeniably one of the greatest movies of our generations. This film plays with the viewers emotions through its entirety and did a fantastic job mixing the different genres the film industry has to offer. Another way to describe this film is that it is a landmark in the industry and offers nothing but innovation. The future is nothing but bright for Nollywood with this films release	positive
Excellent storyline. . . . Forget the critics, this is perhaps the best African movies this year. It has the best plotting and acting and to top it all, the best storyline.	positive
A devastating. true story, deeply moving yet not sentimental. Outstanding performances namely by Damson Idris. Not an easy ride but more real than most out there. Must see.	positive
The 'Set Up' is a step up. A real reach, this movie is some James Bond ish. And for quality; as far as Nollywood goes, 'Set Up' is top of the line. Sterling quality. You will be very proud of Nollywood when you see it. No doubt about that. The 'Set Up' proves that regardless of the troublesome filth swamping Nollywood, there is still great talent there that won't die. This is magnificent quality. Worth every kobo you will spend. We are sure of this, because when the screen closed, rapturous applause erupted.	positive
"the best Nigerian Movie in decades. . . . Honestly, this movie brought back great memories and gave me deep thoughts. This is the best movie out of Nigeria in more than a decade. This compares to old Nigerian movie classics. Kudos to Banky W, this man is pure class. I do not watch Nigerian movies because of the ""garbage"" most churn out, but this move right here deserves an Oscar."	positive
Beautiful, Captivating, Powerful, Raw. . . . This movie captured the troubles faced by the average Gen Z Nigerian kid. It did not gloss over anything. It left you angry and annoyed at some places. It left you triggered which I think was the point. To force the viewer to live the reality of the characters. I'm happy this story got told.	positive
LIONHEART: A Genevieve Nnaji's Love Letter To Nigeria.. . . . She Took The Defunct Nigerian Home Movie Back Home To Enugu, Nigeria. That's BRAVE. It Paid off.	positive
Farming is based upon writer / director Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje's life as a young Nigerian boy who was fostered to a white working class British family in the 1980's. This was something that occurred frequently from the 1960's - 1980's and became known as farming. The film's main focus is on identity and how this young boy grew up confused and alone with a verbally abusive and casually racist white British mother and traditional conservative Nigerian parents who he only saw every few years. He struggled to accept who he was, forming a strong desire to be white and eventually fell in with a group of abusive and violent skinheads, completely losing his way until tragic and violent events eventually lead him back to the right path and accepting his own identity. I thought this was excellent. Damon Idris is superb in the lead role as someone who is filled with so much hate for himself and others who share his cultural identity yet also hates the new group that have formed around him. It's tense, harrowing and a powerful film and my heart breaks for any children that were put through this system because it must have been a real struggle adjusting to life in Nigeria after spending time growing up on the streets with the white British working class .	positive
Mind Blowing Acting By All Actors & Outstanding Picture Quality. . . . I just Watched This Movie and i was Impressed With Almost All the Actors that featured on the movie. The story line is quite interesting and the actors did very very well on the acting.	positive
Worth watching. . Set against the backdrop of the 1976 coup attempt in Nigeria this is a good movie. Not much shoot em up but good drama.	positive
Heart-felt movie...No frills or thrills, but really enjoyable.	positive
The timing of this film must be written in the stars. It is an original twist on a themes of family/ racism / fascism. Profound moments of child craving for a family and intimacy, alongside abusive grooming. It punches you in the stomach. Kudos to the writer/director who worked tirelessly to get the project on screen an the major U.K film funders stayed away from it. He also took the project to Creative England's iFeatures but didn't make the cut... In a way, it works to the writer/directors hand to have a told a bold British story based on a True Story with Hanway films. Watch & Support playing now!	positive
Simply relating the narrative of Andrew Dosunmu‚Äôs seductive immigrant drama Mother of George would do little to convey the film‚Äôs stark, poetic power, much less its extraordinary visual and sonic acumen.	positive
With drama and efficiency... Pefect and very sad...	positive
Lionheart is a lovely movie that used long shots to show of the scenery quite well. I heartily recommend.	positive
Two couples survive the woes of war in Biafra. Film for TV but with a complicated history. The war is not shown to be very bloody.	positive
Really deep great film. . . . Amazing film takes you on a roller coaster ride Damson is an amazing actor and smashes this role ......Well Done Ade üëäüèΩ110%	positive
One of the first things that strike you in This Lady Called Life are the vivid colours, they give the movie such a great quality.	positive
Excellent movie. . . . Well written, loved the combination of drama and comedy. I have recommended it to friends	positive
I appreciate the story and all the intrigue. Sometimes i found angry but the end is beautiful. We have to decide for our life, nobody will do it for us.. . I appreciate the dresses of the actor principal. She is beautiful with her braids - natural is better.	positive
Love at war. . . . Two couples survive the woes of war in Biafra. Film for TV but with a complicated history. The war is not shown to be very bloody.	positive
It was completely refreshing to watch from start to finish. An intresting deviation from the typical Nollywood movie. Veteran actors Pete Edochie and Nkem Owoh effortlessly show us why they are the best in Nollywood. Genevieve definitely sets a standard for local Nollywood movies with Lions Heart and as for her Directorial debut, someone give her an award!	positive
The Wedding Party is something that is actually well-produced and directed. Also, the actors are good and/or appear to be having a good time.	positive
A film that simply seeks to raise awareness.. . . . Quality. Entertaining Baffling. Current. The script is interesting and smart. Told in two times where the present is in full screen and the past in cinema mode. A film that simply seeks to raise awareness. A powerful African drama.	positive
Well crafted, highly personal story told with superb acting. . . . Definitely worth seeing.	positive
Brilliant!. . . . Kemi, your work is outstanding. You just keep absolutely getting better. Can't wait for future productions. Was thoroughly entertained.üíÉüëç	positive
Love it. . . . The movie is great. The storyline is good, Acting not bad at all. . 	positive
Arie and Chuko Esiri‚Äôs film is understated in its attunement to the challenges of trying to escape a stagnant existence	positive
It is still a MUST watch movie as it still captures the quintessence of the issue and delivers a clear message.	positive
Castle & Castle is a well written dramatic Nollywood series. The characters are multi-dimensional and realistic. As an American, I most enjoyed seeing the legal system in action against the backdrop of the uniqueness of Lagos.	positive
Breaded Life is a true Nigerian romantic comedy that will tug at your heartstrings, and you will want to see it again and again.	positive
A charming and colorful gem. . . . The cinematography alone with its charming use of detailed colors makes Eyimofe a must watch. The plot is balanced and compelling with barely any cliches and the acting is phenomenal.	positive
Nice storyline. . Good movie, nice storyline. I like the fact that actors from different African countries acted in this movie.	positive
Not the regular Nigerian movie. . . . Defied all odds. I saw this movie on Amazon Prime. They tried with the plot. To think that I almost didn't see it due to my expectations. I am amazed.	positive
Everything about the movie was well thought out, consisting of an Amazing cast who nailed their roles, an original story and top notch videography	positive
Great step forward in nollywood story telling, and film making. This movie should set the standard for what nollywood movies should look like going forward. A++	positive
Up North the Movie was superb. . . . This film shows off beautiful aspects of Northern Nigeria particularly Bauchi state. I can't wait to visit with my friends. Thank you for telling a beautiful story!	positive
If you love terrible movies you must watch this at least once. The second part is worth a watch as well and features several scenes that easily outdo this chapter in terms of sheer insanity.	positive
Old Nollywood at Its Best. . . . This is a simple and well told story with brilliant cinematography. Lionheart is unapologetic in its display of Nigerian culture. The movies also passes several subtle messages of leadership, parental support, strength, perseverance and peace between different tribal groups.	positive
Great Movie! A must watch. . . . This movie is a must watch. It amplifies the lifestyle of the wealthy Lagosians, The 1% of the 1%.	positive
The onscreen chemistry between Ramsey and Rita is a testament to their skills and legendary status in Nollywood. It is also lovely to see Chidi Mokeme, who we think has been away for too long.	positive
Great movie, great acting. would be nice to see a part 2 of it.	positive
Painstakingly conceived and teeming with raw, unbridled energy, Eyimofe offers a sumptuous, keen-eyed look at modern Lagosian life.	positive
The tone of the film is also unexpectedly lyrical -- like a fairytale, albeit grimmer than Grimm. Unrelieved horror and violence can be enervating, but this film has the benefit of truth, and a message of survival.	positive
Outstanding quality and acting.. . . . For a first time director and two times producer of films ,nnaji is heading for greatness. Beautiful film to say the least. And a very calming movie with smiles üòÄ. A drama movie without drama! She can only get better from here.	positive
I  just watched this at The Newport Beach Film Festival, and this has got to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. The movie had a good pace with excellent writing & production.	positive
Very disturbing but gripping. . . . This was one of the most uncomfortable films I've watched and made me feel quite emotional. I was unfamiliar with 'farming' until this film and thank you to the writer and director for making it free to view during this time of the BLM stuggles 2020. The story drew me in and the characters were well acted and believable. The story was unrelentingly tense throughout. The ending gives no answers to the issues explored in the film but leaves the viewer to grapple with them. Very glad to have watched this and it will stay with me for a while	positive
Good movie.... a must watch...waiting for season three	positive
a week in the life of nigerians. good stuff.	positive
"Forget its old school Nollywood style title, 'Mama Drama' isn't just good. It is more than good. This movie is the real deal - A True Gem: Super fantastic. Super immersive. Absolutely shattering drama. And its story is simple and sick. ""Sick"" as in ""freakishly good"".. . . . While Shaffy Bello stands out majestically; the acting here is generally, all round; Perfect! Honestly, the flawlessness of this flick is indescribable. Even the funny parts feel so real, they are life-like funny. So funny, you will be stumping your feet like you need to run out of your seat.. . . . Yet, 'Mama Drama' is not a comedy. Neither does it pretend to be one. No. Not at all. 'Mama Drama' is drama in its purest sense. It is cogent, potent, thick and concentrated. Absolutely Amazing. Not to be missed."	positive
A true and daring eye to human trafficking. . . . This is my 3rd Nollywood movie and I am shocked. Really true, disturbing, unsettling. Some people are writting comments about the ending the cinematography etc, what did you expect? These real life subjects do not have a happy ending and no script. If you wish to see something easy and comforting you should look somewhere else.....	positive
Brilliant acting! Thrilling story. . I have watched this movie 3 times now and was not bored for once. Storytelling couldn't be more apt. Acting was so professionally done. A political story told in an interesting way. Trust me on this, u will love it. A must watch by all means!	positive
This was a great movie! It accurately depicted the beauty of Nigeria. It also did a great job at showing the Yoruba and Igbo culture in such a positive light. Loved the storyline.	positive
A feelgood story the entire family can watch, and Nnaji's performance makes you want to see Adaeze win in the end.	positive
Awesome Movie. . Movie was awesome. Protagonist was amazing Storyline was great Choice of music was on point. Casting Great.	positive
#LoveCitation. . I should have rated this movie 100% but nothing can be 100% perfect even though the entirety of the movie is close to perfection. Mr kunle Afolayan has never disappointed us for once right from the day's of #irapada,it's always from one level of professionalism to another. Always amazing and giving the best.	positive
Good movie	positive
Humbling, Heartwarming, Funny, & Empowering	positive
This is one of the most striking entries in the 2013 global wave of black cinema, but also admittedly one that poses hurdles to audiences with conventional expectations.	positive
The production quality of La Femme Anjola is very good. It is hard to believe it is not Rita Dominic singing directly, which speaks of very good directing and editing.	positive
Plot seems boring at first but brilliant movie overall. . . . I would say Road to yesterday is your typical 'Genevieve' movie. Slow- paced, good acting and drama filled. The movie starts out with an obvious quarrel between a couple (played by Genevieve Nnaji & Oris Erhuero) which seemed normal at first, but however dragged on for the better part of the movie (boring at some points). You are left in the dark curious about the cause of the quarrel but this is revealed bit by bit through constant flashbacks, eventually all is left bare and the plot kicks in. Recommended if you are not going to the theater expecting an endless action plot, but rather mature drama. Suitable characters, good plot and overall an interesting movie.	positive
Best movie I've ever watched. This guy deserves an Oscar.	positive
An Absolute fantastic storyline. . . . This show is not it all what I thought it was going to be. It is 10 times better. The different issues by each of the students and how they collectively group together to work them out, excellent and very positive. I am hoping for a season two	positive
LIONHEART brings true cinematic feels in an industry where movies don't always hit that not while showcasing outstanding acting by all characters and cinematography . Kudos to Genevieve nnaji on this masterpiece!!!!	positive
Lionheart is not just a good movie that made a dent in a rusty and stagnant Nollywood industry, this is a new beginning from which the young upcoming Nigerian filmmakers and actors know it is possible to put Nigeria on the global map of film.	positive
The story line was quite good and didn't take itself too seriously which made it a fun watch, the colours and clothes were wow! The cinematography was incredible, the actors and actresses did a good job.	positive
The extremely violent story is based loosely on the childhood experiences of director Adewale. And it is his passion for this project which sets Farming above so many other homegrown movies you will see this year.	positive
Worth It!!!. . The plot twist is wowing. Coming from Nollywood, this is an idea portrayed beautifully. Niyi did a wonderful job. Respect that.	positive
The storyline of Mama Drama is like a refreshing glass of rare wine, something different and unusual. It pushes the envelope.	positive
One of the Best movie from Nigeria so far. . . . A Better family is a movie that I'm very proud of when it comes to Nigerian Nollywood movies. This is a movie that you got to enjoy every bit of it from beginning to the end. It's strong lesson on relationship for both married and singles always blow me away. This movie is a must watch for both married and singles.	positive
Just stunning. . . . Such a beautiful movie. Stunning scenes of Africa. A beautiful depiction of an accidental love story with believable characters looking for more in life	positive
Well the movie is bad, but the story kept me watching until the end, which a I cannot say for a lot of new big production movies.	positive
Good Cinematography. . . . Compelling story with good acting to go with. Sterling performance by the newbie. Cant wait for the next one.	positive
This movie was excellent. Nollywood stand up!!	positive
"A mild, yet brutal, racial quandried film which can't help but, to me, recall American History X.... Kate brought me here and it was great to see her as a ""regular"" person."	positive
I've never before seen a Nollywood film, so I was intrigued as to what director Biyi Bandele's 'Fifty' would be like. As it turns out, it was pretty much an African version of 'Dynasty'!	positive
The audience's attachment to and investment in these people lend powerful intimacy to the large scale epic trappings.	positive
I liked it, I enjoyed myself, it was not a master piece, but a nice watch. Well done.	positive
It is interesting that For Maria is a 2020 movie and is now available on Netflix in 2022. This is an overall excellent Nollywood production, and deserves to be seen by everyone.	positive
WARNING YOU HAVE GOT TO WATCH THE END OF THE CREDITS THROUGHOUT THIS MOVIE AS SOMETHING HAPPENES AT THE END OF THE CREDITS THROUGHOUT THIS MOVIE........	positive
I love old movies like this	positive
Super Recommended. What a Wawu! We are clapping for you üëèüëèüëè. . If it's a comedy at all, it's a comedy for intelligent people. One that makes bursting into laughter, a result of your brain being tickled. Exceptional. üèÜ	positive
This film was funny, and it would probably been funnier to me if the accents weren't so thick while talking so fast. It was a pleasant flick and I totally enjoyed it.	positive
Fantastic. . . . This for me is way better than all the over hyped nollywood wedding party, Chief daddy and what-have-you. The humour wasn't forced, it came about naturally. Fantastic acting and great plot. Really enjoyed it.	positive
A movie for weekend relaxation. . It's a good movie to watch with family and friends after a long week. Particularly interesting is the strength of some of the characters as they played their roles. Good job to the director, cast and crew.	positive
Simple and creative, beautiful production Nigerian.... . A light comedy, with intelligent and fun dialogues, that veiled humor, charismatic characters, and the seriousness and sobriety of the protagonist enchant... A real mechanics lesson for us, moviegoers and car curiosity, very cute, simple and creative, beautiful production Nigerian...	positive
Intriguing watch. . . . Such a brilliant story line. Enjoyed every bit of it It was a beautiful showcase of Northern Nigeria.	positive
Very unpredictable movie, the best Nigerian movie in history. Well done Kemi Adetiba and the cast, couldn't tell that most of the actors are not so experienced when watching the movie. Well done!!	positive
One of the most difficult films I've ever watched. . Thank you Google for making this a free rental.	positive
An excellent short documentary. Definitely worth the watch.	positive
Citation is an important window into the gender politics of a culture seemingly very different √¨nto our own, but where the nuts-and-bolts sexist dynamics that have oppressed and left women around the world open to abuse remain sadly familiar	positive
excellent coming of age story.. . . . I loved this show. I binged it and HOPE there is another season. I work in higher ed and the students depicted are true to form Great combination of comedy and drama. Wisdom made me laugh so hard. He was excellent. the blend of the story lines were great.	positive
Compelling story	positive
"Recommend, strictly for Baba Suwe's crowd. Because; flamboyantly nonsensical, 'Sugar Rush' is a ""Baba Suwe"" feem. There's simply no art to it - The comedy it offers is terribly predictable and sorely obvious. Lacking in any subtlety or thoughtfulness, this movie was not made for the intellectual viewer. It was made for the mob; that Baba Suwe crowd. 'Sugar Rush' was crafted specifically to please them. Only them. And it worked. It worked spectacularly:. . . . The hall was packed. And from start to finish, this crowd laughed their heads off. From minute to minute, explosions of laughter filled the room. People, violently animated by punchlines; literally tore out of their seats and jerked back furiously, time and time again, seemingly having lost control of their bodies. Visibly drunk with incessant laughter, they laughed hard and coughed out even louder -  'Sugar Rush' wouldn't give them a moment's rest to catch their breaths.. . . . So loud and continuous was the laughter, you could feel the atmosphere vibrating with the fire of their satisfaction. It was amazing to watch. For these people, 'Sugar Rush' was exactly that; A Rush of Sugar. And they loved it beyond description. We can well testify to that. Nevertheless, we hated it. Every single second of it. 'Sugar Rush' was a celebration of The Ridiculous. And it was utterly foolish."	positive
Lovely movie... a mix of everything	positive
Great acting and love story. . . . Loved. Loved this film. It's so refreshing to see wonderful love stories coming out of Africa. I am now searching for these actors in other movies.	positive
I loved it. . . . I love it, Is it the plot? Cinematography? Actors and culture/ language showcasing , Absolutely beautiful. Nollywood to the world.	positive
There's a lot to this film--and one that, in some ways, cuts across all cultures. Well worth seeing.	positive
I thought it was a traditional action movie. But it has a very good story with meaningful inspiration. It uncovers the competition between weapons and water in Africa.	positive
Relatable. . . . This was a very well acted Nollywood film. My experience with previous films from Africa that I've watched haven't been acted well.	positive
This movie, My Village People, gives us a very interesting plot twist that has us laughing and giving an applause, and the conflict resolution is well done, in terms of the script and the acting.	positive
A movie that anyone can relate too. . . . Had the opportunity of viewing this movie at the Oakland Film Festival and exceeded my expectation. It is very entertaining and kept my eyes glued to the screen. It has great humor. The Giwa sister's relationship is very relatable and you go on a journey with them as they get back on their feet. The music in this movie is really really good as well. It is a family friendly movie that I wish I got to watch with my entire family.	positive
The story draws you in so much that you find a bit of yourself in all the characters.	positive
All I can think of is the incredible plot twists and how the entire story came together into a stunning finale.	positive
Underrated masterpiece. . . . Probably one of the best movies I've seen and is definitely a classic like The Godfather imo definitely is a much watch movie	positive
While it's certainly social commentary, Gone Too Far is also a breath of fresh air in the often stifling stable of British sociorealism.	positive
Beautiful. . This was a light and absolutely hilarious movie. Good actors and well executed. Makes for a cost relaxed watch	positive
Let me quickly drop my thoughts. . . . This movie relates to the current situation of most Nigerian youths, it doesn't matter how you make your money Just be successful that's all. Nice delivery from Gabriel, definitely one of our best actors!	positive
Brilliant !. . . . Oloture is raw and pure art ... excellent production excellent acting by the entire cast Sharon Ooja was simply amazing . Oloture is a must watch	positive
Beautiful acting, beautiful directing, not so great story. . I had to open an account just to review this movie. This is a beautiful work of art.. . 	positive
Good movie. . . . Both Okon and Bona are excited about the opportunities in London and are quickly shown the racist and selfish realities of living there. Though both are educated and came for educational enrichment, they are exploited and thrust into homelessness, even betrayed by fellow Nigerians living in London. Luckily Bona meets with some compassionate folks who help him and provide shelter, food and companionship. He is also able to help Okon when they happen upon each other in the city. Glad the ending had one of them going back with the goal of enriching and giving back to his homeland.	positive
Low-key, low-budget, high-intelligence, this is precisely the kind of film London ought to be producing.	positive
Absolutely love it!. . . . I'm usually not psyched about watching Nollywood films but this is definetly one of those you just can't afford to miss especially if you love love. The story was very crafted and the actors portrayed all the emotions in such a beautiful way. It's definitely one you will love to watch over and over again. Well done to everyone involved in the film making process. I was really impressed.	positive
A good Nigerian movie. . . . The war in Nigeria is a very regrettable conflict and this film shows us the dark side of the country; it's a good action drama movie.	positive
This movie is a bit hard to follow but it is worth the effort. A sort of Romeo and Juliet story set in Nigeria. The parents are like all others wanting only the best for the kids. If you like romantic comedies, pay close attention and you will be rewarded in the end.	positive
This movie was recomended to me by my wife. it's a good overal production with some very good acting and production design. 	positive
I am amazed, a Nigerian movie kept me glued to the screen for 3 hours without missing a beat. This is excellence. I really enjoyed it. Watch out world !	positive
Ms Adetibe assuaged a thirst I had always longed for: Nigeria in all its realness. Politics, religion, poverty, wealth, God-fatherism, entitlement mentality, corruption and then HOPE. Nollywood. . It could be done and She did it! A  movie worthy of export!. . . . This is Nigeria!!	positive
76 is an excellent piece of artwork. The quality of the work shows the effect of military consultation that was done, and it demonstrates how Nollywood stands to benefit from consulting professionals in portraying their fields and activities, to give the audience the right type of authentic experience.	positive
Indian-Afrika story, new and refressing, unfornutally bad story and acting.	positive
Lionheart. . . . Genevieve Nnaji is a seasoned actress and she proves her worth in the industry after 20 years that she is still the best with her directing debut. we only have to say well done ma	positive
Really looking forward to season 2. . . . I'm really looking forward to season 2. I was happily surprised by the quality and depth of the stroy and characters!	positive
Read movie! Don't understand why this got such a low rating!	positive
Good film. . . . With a small budget this film deserve a very good critic.Finally a film with a gay theme without a tragedy. One moving story, with good actors.I recognize problems with edition, and other small Technics problems.But who care about this, when we see a film so full of truth and tenderness??? Sometimes I ask me why films about gay man are sad,dramatic? Why can we have a film with gay thematic without hope? Some scenes for me were really sublime. The story is very sensitive, principally because the plot is about black, gay and poor people. I would like to see more films like this: simple, direct, full of truth, one real story.This story can happen.	positive
I found this to be a very good movie. I haven't read the novel on which it's based, but I'd like to. I hope that Bandele turns out more movies.	positive
Best Nigerian movie, hands down!. . It was a great movie that showcase our Nigerian culture, loved it!	positive
Held my attention. . . . Good show, held your attention, great story line, loved the mystery and drama as well as some comedy. Loved the story line of the Christian life on campus. Hopefully, there's a season 2. Would like to know what happened to the lecturer, and Neo if he got immunity. However, would be good if there's a season 2.	positive
This film is done at a slow, steady, believable pace. I was completely drawn into the story and connected with all the actors as if I knew them.	positive
Families learning to accept other cultures.	positive
Beautiful Story/Script. . . . I enjoy the the storyline The cast played their role well. Felt all the emotions and feels. . . . Definitely worth the watchüíØ	positive
A Naija Christmas takes us from the idyllic Ikoyi, where everything is calm and high-class, to the bubbling Mushin, where you can be obtained if you don‚Äôt stand well. You see the beauty of Lagos at night, when it is well lit. You feel the real Naija Christmas spirit, and you want to share it with others.	positive
To say she loves her country this much!! Even Made in Nigeria cars and natural hair dos .lot of details Nnaji	positive
One of the best Nollywood movies of the past decade!	positive
"Destiny Ekaragha's ""Gone Too Far"" is so London, so Naijia, so Jamaica, and just so hilarious to boot. It had me in stitches, laughing so hard until those stitches opened. Loved the movie's fast paced story-line, catchy sound tracks, brilliant cast, and talented actors"	positive
One salutary feature of this sharply observed film is that it does not eel compelled to make Seyi in any way magical: he cannot transcend the sump of addiction and corruption in which he allows himself to sink.	positive
The comedy is of a wide spectrum; you will laugh at the events in the movie	positive
Nigerian Prince stands out for its setting, making it a welcome addition to the crime movie pantheon.	positive
Really Good Movie. . This is probably the best Nigerian movie I've ever seen. Definitely a class above your usual light Nollywood stuff. Characters and plot were well developed and realistic. Noah and Dominic were really great in their acting.	positive
I am a Litigator and I am impressed by they work put in, I was held by the storyline and I truly applaud a really impressive piece of work. Well done guys, very well done. üëèüèæüëèüèæüëèüèæ	positive
A must watch. . Beautiful romance movie. I just decided to try it when saw it on Netflix and there was nothing to regret. The songs chosen were really good.	positive
In spite of the less than satisfactory parts of Ayinla, the movie, it is an excellent work of art, and Lateef Adedimeji‚Äôs less than brilliant performance did not take away from the overall satisfaction derivable.	positive
Lionheart is a creative gift, a joyous feet of cast ensemble, potent storyline and qualitative production. From the beautiful lead character, Genevieve Nnaji to Nkem Owoh, we feel the lives of people who maybe different from us,share a unifying tie.	positive
What a Movieüëêüëêüëê. . . . What a classic movie. All the casts wEreÃÅ epic. Suspense, Comedy & words of Wisdom.	positive
Lovvveeeee. . . . So relatable! Sad there is only one season. Stayed up til 2am watching this show!	positive
This is the beginning of good production. You can do better. Just believe.	positive
A really hard watch, but worth watching.	positive
Seven reminds me of an American Movie, the Ultimate Gift, with a Nigerian twist, and it achieved its aim.	positive

Sergeant Tutu' turned out to be an imbecilic drama chuck full of bad acting, plagued by a lack of chemistry, held together by out of place narration and clapped along by ridiculous cartoonish tunes.	negative
Sista Sista' is yet another colossal waste of money starring Enyimma Nwigwe, making it two crappy movies he has headlined in one weekend.	negative
It's the worst film I've ever seen, the acting is so hammy, just crap, awful and so painful to watch, it's just terrible, it's incredibly dull, I wouldn't watch it again.	negative
Overacting dominates the action, making this a tough slog throughout.	negative
The production value is a little sloppy	negative
Wasn't really a clear plot, didn't make sence and just havingofo a Nigerian man cussing a Jamaican cuss word is not Jamaica??	negative
The movie is a total waste of time and if you're yet to see it, PLEASE DON'T.	negative
Wrote better stories at 6years. . . . The storyline is very shallow, i mean she basically ended all her problems by falling in love with a man after selling the narrative of an independent strong woman. I have a feeling Netflix only bought this to paint Nollywood as shallow to the rest of the world.	negative
Complete rubbish.	negative
The failure at the attempts turns out to be quite funny actually.	negative

Absolutely not recommended for sophisticated people.	negative
No I will not! Please Nigerian filmmakers, not everything has to be funny. I beg you.. . That was such a let-down guys, such a let-down!	negative
A rushed, redemptive montage towards the film‚Äôs end is presented as ickily aspirational.	negative
This is a story of pain, waiting and hope, but it is sometimes confusing.	negative
I appreciate the attempt at efficiency, but without getting some sense of the characters we are dealing with (and their relationship to one another), nothing has any resonance and it's hard to follow what's going on.	negative

Storyline was poor, plot development and dialogue were equally bad.	negative
"Absolute rubbish. . . . I'm always on the hunt for a good Rom Com to watch with my wife. This had a review score over 6, so we gave it a crack. We literally stopped watching it after 10 minutes. Rubbish acting, like cringe worthy acting. I don't know who reviewed this with high scores in the past, but it's not worth the watch. The acting was just ""that bad"". Plus the story, as far as we watched was just terrible, b-grade stuff."	negative

"Small Chops' is an awesomely stupid movie that is not worth paying premium for. In all fairness this movie should have been gently released on Iroko TV; definitely not in cinema.

A freshly deceased corpse, it has only a few spasms of laughs to offer - A quip here and a giggle there, for most part however, it rendered the hall; Graveyard Silent. Its, was a story of gigantic failures; misfire after misfire, scene after scene closed to the tune of hissy echoes rather than ""LOLs""."	negative
The movie has an identity crisis.	negative
Enitan's trauma is revelled in but for what? Few new truths are learned here.	negative
A credible ending could have also changed my rating to a higher one. This one is for the 1980's.	negative
REALLY STAINS NOLLYWOOD. . This film is ridiculous with no plot motivation or character development.	negative
I  guess it was not a comedy?!. . . . The way the shots are made was like it is a comedy movie.	negative
Nollywood does the evil-kid-run-amok movie, replacing creepiness, tension and terror with broad comedy, needlessly over-long scenes and general irritation.	negative
Extremely terrible	negative
Chief Daddy 1 has a weak plot, but some serious laughter that makes up for the poor story. This second coming  has zero plot and no laughter at all.	negative
Newcomers will be puzzled by the clumsy contextualisation and muddled motivation of characters who, robbed of their inner lives by a clunky script, are left floundering amid the melodrama and speak-the-plot dialogue.	negative
Kpali' has nothing. A profoundly useless movie, 'Kpali' is an empty box, literally. A ludicrous and baseless story that needed no telling.	negative
This movie was so poorly made that I only got through the first half hour (or so); after trying twice.	negative
Despite an intriguing historical setup, '76 struggles to tell a cohesive political story, and loses its thread as the personal subplots overshadow the events of the coup.	negative
iT IS NOT BASED ON ANY FACTS	negative
It just happens that the good guys are brown skinned, and the bad guys are white skinned.	negative
i wanted to watch a bad movie but this shit was CRAZY so many twist and turns, the obvious green screen. Obsessed	negative
I was expecting more than it delivered.	negative
The sound quality of the movie was not crisp, and that contributed to the less than desirable experience.	negative
"Such a shame really. We saw this earlier today, with a small audience of ladies and guys; couples and individuals alike- The irritation in the hall was uniform. So it was that; as we trooped out of the hall, unusually, standing at the door was a lady, we suspect she works for the cinema. She asked everyone together: ""What did you think about the movie?"" And as if rehearsed, the phrases ""Rubbish movie"" and ""Very stupid"" immediately rent the air, echoing from one person to the next. We were not surprised. Because you see, the biggest shame here is that we predicted this would happen."	negative
This is so so so so so [...] so bad!!!!	negative
The plot is unbelievably bad, and the actors obviously do not comport themselves in a way that suggests they believe in the script.	negative
"The Enemy I know' is an extremely lazy concoction. Everything about it is below par - even the ""police woman"" shows the back of her I.D card whilst effecting an arrest - whereas; this is 2019 and ""Aki & Paw Paw"" mistakes such as this are untenable in cinema. Ridiculous!"	negative
To summarize the plot, it was leaking like a sieve.	negative
They're really sticking with the ham-fisted christian propaganda, just as much as the unnecessarily long takes and terrible audio mixing.	negative
Its highlights include; bad acting, shabby story-telling, horrendous make-up and an idiotic story that feels more like badly told gist than a written down story.	negative
This is like a high school class project. The story is stereotypical and predictable, and the jokes aren‚Äôt funny.	negative

Waste of time. . Very misleading.	negative
Impossible to see this as anything other than heinous after learning about the real-world suffering this film and its writer have a direct hand in perpetrating.	negative
Okay, from the onset, the movie was a disaster. The script is awful, the directing is awful and the actors a so awful.	negative
This was bad in so many ways	negative
kinda boring and inconsistent. a lot of confusing narratives choices	negative
Papa Ajasco comes to cinema in this exceptionally ridiculous and ostentatiously foolish comedy.	negative
Though the central performance is impressively raw Farming‚Äôs uncompromising bleakness drowns out the fascinating story, making it a far tougher watch than it needs to be	negative
The road to mediocrity is paved with good intentions ...	negative
I want my time of life back	negative
Many times when a movie lacks plot and good acting, it would have some redeeming qualities, but Chief Daddy 2 has none.	negative
Amidst shabby production and wobbly acting, 'Dagger' tells an unoriginal story in an unoriginal way, complete with unoriginal twists and turns, so much so it ends up feeling jumbled, broken and antiquated.	negative
Started out decent then crashed and burned	negative
Real life vs. badly executed. . . . . But it is a shame, that we get something that has a meaning and does depict colonialism as evil and the repurcussions that happen while invading territories	negative
The comedy did not slap, and the punchlines were weak and too tepid to elicit laughs from the audience	negative
It is probably one of the worst things I have seen in decades, fragmented storyline, completely ridiculous premise and the acting is some of the most painful I've seen.	negative
Horrible, waste of resources	negative

Soppy and touristy..	negative
The acting is bad	negative
As anyone who sits through this misguided film will subject themselves to a litany of disgusting racist and sadistic incidents.	negative
Lacking in the Christmas spirit, this movie...I have nothing to say actually. It was funny, interesting.	negative
"Baby Steps' is not a movie. Literally, ""Crap!""."	negative
Only when the protagonists' lives are at stake - and bombs drop - does the piece truly come alive, with a sense of much-needed urgency.	negative
Cheesier than Disney; badly made. It looks like it was made it a month for sure and was the best at being mediocre.	negative
Only in broad Nollywood comedy mode does it feel truly convincing.	negative
The Enemy I know' is a substandard mess.	negative
But the sound was not always go	negative
It doesn't go wholly wrong all at once, but damned if the filmmakers don't lose the thread and stumble and lurch and pad this thing until their Nollywood film is Bollywood length, without the wit, warmth or content to justify it.	negative
"Don't know what kind of shop they're running over there at ""Ebony Life"", but 'Your Excellency' is an embarrassment to their reputation of eminence in production values."	negative
Trying to get a grasp on Nollywood but this film is by far the worst so far and does not encourage further digging.	negative

A Rose for Freddie' is a hapless drama that is yet another notch in the string of embarrassments Nollywood keeps sneaking into cinemas.	negative
Do what you want	negative
And this is not a comedy; yet there are hundreds of examples worse than this.	negative
A shame that a film with such a fascinating backstory.	negative
This movie is so poorly made, so uninteresting, so far fetched that I can't really say it's worth the time.	negative
Disappointing	negative
This movie is too typical, too stale, too local & too dumb to be exhibited at a premium.	negative
A WASTE OF TIME. . This movie is bad... Very bad. . üò†üò†üò†üò†	negative
Was going to rate it a 7 but..... . With a abrubt ending it destroyed the whole movie.	negative
Not a movie. A series of nothing strung together with sanctimonious messaging.	negative
Terrible movie.... so sloooooow...... bad acting...and bad dialogue....	negative
Main issue was all of the sexist elements in story, dialogue and camera work. Acting was hit or miss.	negative
Starts okay but so disjointed and lousy script the film was a waste of effort	negative
if you are a sucker for Yoruba movies (nothing wrong with being one), you have to know that 'Alubarika' is just another run of the mill Yoruba mov	negative
Could have been a great movie but muddles along with many scenes rushed as it cuts back and forth between the historical backdrop and the love melodramas	negative
utterly, not recommended.	negative
"A nauseating soundtrack that is the singing of the title ""Ajibade"" on over & over again - sung by the lead actor, maybe for cost cutting or worse; a consequence of believing friendly lies affirming a non existent musical prowess."	negative
I watched this against my will	negative
So this is a disjointed mess of a movie.	negative

The opening scene is a reminder of the early stages of Nollywood, and not in a good way.	negative
It involves an odious acting and terrible story-telling.	negative
It's spooky and atmosperic with a slow-creeping dread that doesn't really pay off in the end.	negative
The story is one of the most clich√© storylines from late 80s and early 90s nonsensical rom-coms which made absolutely no sense whatsoever.	negative
"Unlike that one which had no ghosts to boast of, 'Ghost and The Tout Too' doesn't understand that movie-making is rooted in brain-work and not in using cinema to do ""Yahoo"", abusing stardoms to fleece fandoms. Sadly."	negative
Poor acting with shallow characters	negative
Brain Go Pain You Tire	negative
Again and again BIAS BIAS	negative

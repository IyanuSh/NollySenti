"A steamy soap opera unfolding against the backdrop of a cautionary history lesson reminding us that in Nigeria, the more things change, the more they stay insane.",positive
"An enormous amount of work and scrutiny went into making this. Such an enormous amount, its quality stands out easily and brazenly. The sheer amount of authenticity is simply breathtaking.",positive
"My Village People is a movie that will have you losing your home training while watching it. But it is a pathfinder of sorts. Nollywood generally has not done a good job of making the supernatural sexy and appealing. My Village People achieves it effortlessly, and deserves copious amount of praise.",positive
"The story is nothing we haven't seen before but its told from a Nigerian perspective, its funny, quirky and the dialogue is great when compared with others available in the Nigerian market.. . . . I totally enjoyed the movie, would definitely recommend (to my Naija folks!).",positive
"1980's, drug mules, beautiful black women ... I'm in heaven",positive
"Realistic but slow pacing and very melodramatic.. . . . Good acting, based on true events and a decent story. The pacing was a little too slow for my liking and some scenes feel like a made-for-tv movie (the cheese music and the over dramatization).. . . . Overall watchable if you know what you are getting into ahead of time.",positive
"Correction.. . . . Thanks for this. I am impressed with it. But I Nelson Orah played the character of Ahmed, not Umar. I will appreciate it if it is corrected.",positive
She is' Super Fantastic! You want to see this movie. This movie is extraordinarily enjoyable. Pure Nollywood sweetness.,positive
"I was thrilled after watching the movie, everything was on point. I was particularly impressed with the quality of the cast and crew. The director, Kemi Adetiba did a great job and I'm so proud of her. I have recommended it to so many people. I look forward to watching more of her work.",positive
"Genevieve Nnaji stamps her foot concretely in the pantheon of genuis directors. She doesn't disappoint in her debut, Lion Heart. It's a must watch, as it announces the birth of an international Nollywood.",positive
"Nollywood at its peak!!!!. . . . This movie tells a story about culture, unity and family. So many themes that I can't finish mentioning.",positive
"A Good and Wise film. It was a good film, that shows the dangers of Nigerian tribalism and how it can affect a young love.",positive
this movie is a good offering in the genre.,positive
"Loved this Movie. . . . I was really surprised to read negative reviews for this movie. Do we truly know what a good movie is? This movie was really good, very enjoyable. Well developed characters, believable and relatable story line. And the quality, fantastic. Well done guys. Loved it even more than wedding party 1 and 2. I am not disappointed at all.",positive
Saw the PremiereÃÅ in Houston Texas. . . . This movie should win an Oscar Award. The Storyline is so good. The Actors wereÃÅ all incredible.,positive
"Anyone who loves art, Who's seen part one will know the plot and storyline was already built dEreÃÅ and this was a follow up.",positive
Great outcome.,positive
"Expository Movie. . . . This is a very good and distinct movie. Some people might not like it perhaps because they are used to the love or thriller story films or perhaps because they are not used to life with a vehicle. They movie truly shows how things really are in the life of mechanics, apprentices and customers. It also teachers parents and children a good lesson. It is a seemingly perfect expository movie.",positive
"Understated, powerful crime drama with historical flavor. . This was a very character rich film. Not a single scene was wasted.",positive
Great continuity throughout the movie... The writer and director is highly intelligent and creative. Thank you so much for this amazing movie,positive
"I enjoyed seeing very good parts of Lagos, both on the mainland and the island, used, unlike other movies that stay in one location. Lagos is a beautiful place to shoot a movie, especially if the diversity of the state is put to use, as seen here. Accident scenes are usually tricky for Nollywood to portray, but it was a pleasant surprise to see a very believable one here.",positive
Citation the movie. . Perfect Movie. Loved every second of the movie. Wished it didn't end,positive
"Akinnuoye-Agbaje's directorial debut is a troubling coming-of-age story based upon the directors own experiences as a 'farmed out' Nigerian child in the UK during a period of surging xenophobia in the wake of the Windrush generations arrival. The look and feel of the films early moments present a setting and characters so raw and realistic that one could only capture from having experienced them. The pacing of the film in many ways reflects this. At times seeming to take on an almost frantic pace which is meaningful in a way that captures the effect of somebody recalling their life story - made up of the important details and traumatic moments - though occasionally making it difficult to capture and appreciate the passage of time bordering on surreal. The supporting characters similarly are raw and identifiable foils though lacking in the depth required to be whole characters beyond their interactions with the film's lead. Furthermore the film does little to address or contextualize its setting, deliberately choosing to focus on the internal struggles of it's central character. Despite this the films central character is compelling enough to keep the viewer engaged solely in his development throughout the film. Overall Farming is an impressive directorial debut that tackles issues of dual identity and self-hatred in a manner that leaves plenty unsaid but provides a bitter and frequently heartbreaking account of an individuals struggle for meaning and identity. There is so much to be admired about this film which presents an often overlooked period in British history, the importance of such a personal topic deserving of a greater run-time than the films mere 107 minutes.",positive
amazing film must see,positive
Good series. . I really like this show. All the characters are great and I enjoy watching. Hope it stay around for more seasons. Looking forward to the next season!!!,positive
"Working from a script by playwright Darci Picoult, Dosunmu fashions a tale that‚Äôs realistic, melodramatic and culturally specific (we spend as much time ogling colorfully patterned dresses as we do admiring Gurira‚Äôs endlessly expressive face), yet unmistakably archetypal.",positive
Great movie!,positive
"No words to describe the power of this movie and its reminder of how fortunate it is to have never lived through a civil war. Extraordinary story telling of tragic, recent Nigerian history and the humanity within it all.",positive
Beautiful,positive
Rational representation of the Igbos. . . . Lion heart represented what it really means to be Igbo - hard-working and communal system of living.,positive
There is a lot of mediocre acting here and there and some things made little to no sense for me but overall i did enjoy it for what it is. I would probably not watch it ever again but seeing it once is nice.,positive
"While the themes here are, of course, redolent of neorealism, the filmmakers don‚Äôt make ostentatious nods to cinema past. Their voice is their own; the camera is mobile when it needs to be, but stands still much of the time, letting the excellent cast build their characters as the events of the film test their endurance.",positive
"Funny Funny Funny. . . . Oh mehn, this movie is super funny. if you are looking for a movie to lift your mood up then this is the right movie for you.",positive
"Superb movie!!. . This has got to be the best made movie to come out of Nigeria, not to mention hilariously funny!",positive

"The picture quality of this movie is great, and the director did a good job.",positive
Outstanding performance. . . . Temi Otedola's performance was truly stunning. I thoroughly enjoyed the layers that the story had and the way that each key piece of information was revealed.,positive
"A Major Step in taking back our narrative. . . . This movie, has really showed a deep side of the struggles of the people we often ignore. Easy to see a person to judge, but when stories like these are told you start to look at everyone with a different lens. The ending, though abrupt keeps you in a limbo and holds you in a powerful suspense pondering on what you just witnessed.",positive
"Spot On!!! üî•üî•üî•. . Definitely African movie of the year, enjoyed every minute of the 2hours 30minutes üòÄüëèüëèüëèüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•‚úî‚úå",positive
A rare story about the values of family from a very distinctive perspective. Eloquently interpreted with perfect casting,positive
"Finally a great Nigerian film. For years I‚Äôve been hoping that Nigeria would produce a really great film, and that‚Äôs where the Esiri brothers come in.",positive
Honestly this movie is really good production wise and the sequel. Chills from top notch acting.,positive
"Hardly was there a period of 5 minute in this movie with nothing to smile, chuckle or laugh about. I don't think there is a Nigerian movie that beats this in it's genre (Fictional Comedy). The movie effects were as well commendable.",positive
Good Nollywood romantic comedy. . This movie is exactly cheesy enough to make you smile after a bad day.,positive
Nice cross-country movie. . . . The only thing that I don't like about this movie is the way there was little or no interaction with the Nigerian or Indian environment.. . . . Beautiful romantic movie.,positive
The story starts a bit slow but stick with it. Very good story.,positive

"Realistic, entertaining and all round good vibes. I could watch it all day. I wish they would air more than once a week though, asides from that, its just great. Most reality shows come off as scripted but not this one.",positive
On a Nollywood scale I'll give this movie an 9 because of it's unique storyline and excellent production which sets it aside from other Nigerian movies,positive
Good story line. . . . It's a good movie and storyline. Loved it.,positive
"Speechless;. . . . This movie gave me goose bumps I connected in a way that literally tore my soul. Indeed depicted God the way and manner it should God bless the writer, producers and all involved. The actors too are top top everyone did a fantastic job.",positive
"I enjoyed the relationship crafted between Mr. Tayo (Bimbo Manuel) and Ejiro (RMD),",positive

"Beautiful acting, beautiful directing, not so great story. . I had to open an account just to review this movie. This is a beautiful work of art.. . ",positive
Interesting. . . . I really enjoyed this movie. The acting and story line was really good. I found it to be very interesting to wonder about Ishi's life - this for sure is an eye opener to so many who are forced into marriage.,positive
Gabriel Afolayan is in a class of his own as an actor; he always understands the task.,positive
Not as Bad as reviewed.,positive
Great film and great action. . . . Great story original great action and great comedy all combined in one. Thrilling film and great cast.,positive

Awesome. . . . The first time I saw this movie I was blown away. I don't want to sound crazy but I try to study things of this world. I hope to see a second installment with the same characters and a darker plot.,positive
"Amazing. . I'd of normally flicked past this, but honestly it's an amazing story. You can tell it had a low budget, but the direction and screen play is fantastic! The choreography of the fight scenes lacked a little. Worth a watch definitely",positive
Engrossing tale of family and war. . . . I recommend this movie without reservation.,positive
Wow. . . . This movie really made me change my relationship for the best. Great movie. The movie did start off slow but it definitely kept me interested. The flash backs really made the ending even more intense because everything came together.,positive
People will never learn if they don't even try.. . . . This movie tackles so many issues including the biggest one of all. Identity Crisis in Black men.,positive
"Through an economy of exposition, Eyimofe, (translated as ‚ÄúThis is My Desire‚Äù) delivers a timeless, universal portrait of human resilience while establishing Arie and Chuko as a welcome new addition to the filmmaking brood.",positive
"it is a great movie from someone whom we know to be a great storyteller. Gold Statue may not be one of Tade Ogidan‚Äôs best works, but it ranks high up there",positive

"This was fun to watch. . . . The Delivery Boy is very refreshing, a beautiful story, told brilliantly. You should see it!",positive

Great movie. . . . I cannot for the life of me understand the low reviews for such a remarkable film. This series was so good that I binged the entire series as a Medical Student. Great work and thumbs up to the producer and casts.,positive
The production was great a d light years ahead of most of the sub-par movies of African cinema. This movie is truly a great step in the right direction for Afican cinema.,positive
Entertaining live concert featuring lively arrangements of jazz and pop standards and an excellent orchestra,positive
This return of the king is glorious.,positive
Great job!!,positive
"Well crafted, highly personal story told with superb acting",positive
"Still one of the Best Nigerian films of 2017. . Isoken is a great film showcasing the culture of the area of the country. The layout, filming, colors and dressing tell much of the tradition quite well. The film has quite a good inject of laughter and great acting.. . ",positive
Great watch. . . . Great movie! I enjoyed the fact that they promoted the Igbo language!,positive
"Hand-held camera chases, emotionally fraught close-ups, arresting compositions and a script that gives a familiar story a distinctly African flavor make ""√íl√≤t≈´r√©"" a thriller you not only endure but marvel over and embrace.",positive

I love you - I have a baby‚Ä¶,positive

Great film - entertained and educated,positive
"serious drama with subtle comedy, my type",positive
"Wow, this true story! Wow! Amazing. . . . Wow this story! The many many many stories of the Black experience throughout the African diaspora, and throughout generations. I am so glad our Brotha shared his story and got to write, direct, star in. And Damson wow, his acting is always amazing.",positive
Impressive & funny how they portrayed both cultures. I was entertained all through! Clean cut production.,positive
"Excellent delivery. . . . The movie is a wonderful delivery of the sexual assaults on university female student by some lecturer. It passes the message in a simple unsuspecting manner. Unpredictable end however, a few forgivable misses",positive
Amazing. . . . Loved the display if pure culture even in the music. Great to see the people who made me watch nollywood movies again. All round thrilling and very funny..,positive
Fantastic Series from Nigeria. . . . I love this series. Great scenery. Fantastic acting. Everybody was giving their A game. The jokes were natural and very relatable. It was educative as well.,positive

New Pandemic that could happen again!. . . . It's a a brilliant movie and very realistic about what really happened. It's better than the movie Contagion in my book. It really hit close to home for me. It's one of the first serious pandemic in my lifetime. I would really like to purchase this movie on DVD and I've been look in the US but to no avail. Can someone tell me how? Thanks,positive
"How does a movie with this subject matter wind up being this slow and boring? Where is the urgency? Where is the suspense and tension? The editing and the pacing drove me nuts and there's just no way this thing needed to be nearly two and half hours long. And that's really a shame because it highlights a really big and important problem, I just wish it did so without putting the audience to sleep.",positive
"Lionheart is such a beautiful movieüëè. . . . This movie is the best Nollywood movie I've seen so far. Every scene was precise, beautiful and with a touch of humour and a moral lesson. I like that Nigeria was well represented.",positive
Season 2. . . . I loved Season 1 and I could hardly wait for Season 2. I like all the characters. So hopefully you'll keep bringing on the new Series.,positive
"It was a 2hours movie that I rather shouldn't call entertainment but a moment of empowerment. If I was having doubts, my conviction got better... I was able to connect with the movie because obviously, I have experienced a touch of God before.. . . . I say ""yes"" again to God's call.",positive
It almost accurately portrayed the abuses a lot female students face in Nigerian universities and west Africa at large,positive
"Colorful and detailing but thrilling isn't the word. . . . In general, Fifty is standard, beautiful and lively, it is expected to be thrilling at the end but the goose in my pimples didn't show off much but I was happy remembering few lines and scenes at the end.",positive
"Kunle Afo's most impactful movie so far... . . . The movie address a topic that is very fundamental in Nigeria Education system. Good story line, interesting plot, fantastic acting.

"The movie authentically gives us the feel of the eighties, up to how parties were organized, the talk about bleaching, the clothes, and the generous use of damask and adire.",positive
"It's a well paced movie, filled with properly fleshed out characters operating in a plot structure that doesn't fall apart. The film. is brought o life with a stunning aesthetic and masterful cinematography. The story, although not phenomenal, is good enough to keep you glued to your seat while imparting a thing or two about the subject matter.",positive
"Season 2 Please!. . . . I watched ""Fifty Series"" and came upon Castle & Castle because of Tola face was familiar. I love this series and would love for a season 2 to come! I just hate that if left me hanging on the last episode, like a season 2 would be coming. So please give us a season 2!!",positive
"Terrific film!. . . . This is an intense, heartbreaking family drama with an excellent script and stellar acting performances.",positive

They took a risk but the execution from production to acting was very well done.,positive
"Farming may not be the best-executed story, but with a captivating performance by Damson Idris, nevertheless, it is still a story worth telling.",positive

"Brilliant. . . . Good story line that requires so much attention. But overall, the movie is well done.",positive
Great Movie from Nollywood.. . . . Lionheart wasn't just written for the sake of it. It portrayed so many things going on in Nigeria that it'll take one with in-depth and an open mind to see through the movie.,positive
"This is by far the best production from nollywood! It looks more like an African American film. The acting is top notch and to find out it is the lead actresses first film, thumbs up.",positive
"Something like a Shakespearean comedy, full of highly amusing, sharply drawn characters and offering wicked insight into how identity is shaped by city living and immigrant culture clash.",positive
"Nigerians in Brooklyn. . . . This is an amazing film, suspenseful, thoughtful, and colorful.",positive
Temi Otedola did amazing job!,positive
"Thank you for a perfect example of how HE works in our lives: This movie is a gut-wrencher, reminding us how He works through imperfect, repentant people who are only called to obey Him. He does the rest. He is faithful to complete what He has started. What a GOD honoring movie, showing the Triune in goodness and glory and power. Thank you.",positive
Stroyline was beautiful. . . . The plot twist was everything. Suspense filled. Gripping and interesting. Touched a lot on the importance of communication in relationships. I'll watch it over and over again.,positive
I love this film! I've watched it several times. I hope another one is in the works,positive
A Modern Nigerian Classic. . . . . . Nollywood truly has a political/religious/tribal gem here for those who seek to broaden their perceptions of the whys of the major ills of the world & in this case a small community in Nigeria - r so pervasive today.. . . . Soul comes to this physical reality for experiences & this film delivers a ton of them‚ù§,positive
Fun to watch especially if u understand the Igbo language... But in general it's a good and interesting movie..,positive
This movie feels like a mish mash of under-developed ideas with a half hearted romance thrown in. It is not sure if it wants to be a comedy or a satire.,positive
Genevieve Nnaji proves yet again while she's still the best Nollywood actress of all time with her directing debut. we can only say more grease,positive
A film which captured a nation's hope for better cinema. . . . One can only wish that other Nigerian filmmakers will build on this same ground for a much brighter Nigerian film future.,positive
"Absolutely sensational. . . . This made me feel proud to be Nigerian. Storyline aside, the performances from each character wEreÃÅ phenomenal and really captured my attention.",positive
"Searching for a soundtrack & review. . . . There'se a soundtrack at the end of the movie. On the background. It contains no words, it's more a melody. I'm trying to find the name of it.. . . . Beside that, great movie, really slow paced. Acting is realistic. No absurb emotions or anything like that. The conversations, the choosen words, the evens, the chemistry. It looks natural like you're watching a real situation. There's alot of silent moments and stuff like that. So you either like this type of movies, or you don't",positive
"my number one nigeria sci fi best movie. . I love the movie, it falls into my favorite type which i am satisfy off, looking forward for nigeria to bring more to screen.. . . . And my advice for us Nigerian is to support this movie to encourage them to bring and produce more better movies of our choice for us to watch.",positive

Perfection. . . . Someone should please help me find a mistake in this movie because I have watched it four times and still I can't find one. Everything about the movie was perfect. The movie is an original.,positive
This film is is a true story and is absolutely brilliant and moving.,positive
"A Refreshing Nigerian Series. . . . Such a refreshing Nigerian series to watch without the awful music playing throughout the movie. However. I don't like that Netflix just carried Season 1, got me piqued and their is no season 2 to be found.",positive
"If it were food I would say mouth watering. . . . The film citation is a necessity, I do not see where it would ever run out of relevance. The actors were carefully picked and displayed such professionalism, the location were amazing never new had such good universities in Senegal , the arts and craft of our African leaders carved out the African identity.. . . . The message this movie carries, how it was told is so special, insightful and artistic. The suspense is on another level, the melange of feelings it creates to us the viewers is something else.. . . . Citation is a must watch go watch it on NETFLIX",positive
Excellent Film. . . . This was a great film. A very simple storyline that provides a glimpse into the past to two boys (with many unknowns).. then the twists and turns that surround their reunion as grown men.. . . . Well done! So different from anything I've ever scene.,positive
Loved it. . . . ... beautiful movie ... i love my Nigerians. Beautiful storyline too . Well done,positive

"Historic, Thrilling, Educative and Awesome",positive
This is my favourite Nigerian film. Really enthralling debut feature.,positive
"I deeply appreciated seeing a movie with an emotional bond between two sisters who were connected in so many ways, but disconnected by romance and political views. The movie actors were superb and each character was perfectly cast for their roles.",positive
"An Educational But Visceral & harrowing Film Expertly Crafted. . It's A great movie well acted and Directed Expertly Crafted while Being educational to a degree but it's a fully immersive visceral experience .. . . . Exploring Race ,and Gang Culture ,in England it's hard to believe some of these things Knowing that it was based on true story makes it and even tougher pill to swallow .Maybe a few scenes are for theatrical licence but still it comes from some where real .. . . . There's so many point in the film where i'd just ask why ? why would you do that ! Nooo !. . . . it's not for the faint hearted and it kind of messes with your mind it's the kind of movie that will leave you with many questions. . . . entertaining but thought provoking and intriguing A work of art One of the Most Original Movies I've seen in ages a refreshing perspective Definitely worth a watch",positive
"It was a nice, wholesome movie about Love, Faith, Family and temptations of the world.......was a bit cheesy, but I enjoyed it. Fell in love with Mawuli Gavor and would watch it again just to see him..",positive
Beautiful movie depicting historic events in Benin kingdom. . . . This movie was very educational and intereÃÅsting to watch. I am still in shock it was done in 2014. The acting and directing was superb. . Kudos to the cast and crew.,positive
Great concept. . . . Creative storyline with talented actors. A bit excessive with some of the flashbacks but still very interesting throughout.,positive
"so cool. . . . This was so chilled. this movie was fun and enjoyable from the start. I've found no flaws to it, maybe the introduction is a little corny, but thats just taste. this movie was light but meaningful. highly recommended!",positive
KOB is Number 1 Nollywood movie to me right now. The story is way different and genuine. Unveils what goes on in politics for real.,positive
This was an excellent movie. I would recommend it to anyone!,positive

"Fresh POV. . It is not the kind of cinema we are used to in the western hemisphere, but the production highlights not only a story to develop, but also the colors and culture of the region in which it takes place.",positive
"""Citation"" works best when it hovers in the infuriating skepticism hurled at its young protagonist as she makes her case, and it's unclear whether the system will work in her favor until the final, unnerving act.",positive
"In a movie which seems like it should have been a mini-series, we follow a relationship, which grows into a family, over the course of 20 years in Nigeria.",positive
"Finally, a good one. . . . A solid entry from the stables of Ayo Makun that combines genuine comedy with love at heart. A must watch for all Nigerians.",positive

Best Nigerian movie seen in a long while. . Amazing movie that really l captures Nigerian culture and its movie industry,positive
"What a disturbing but engaging story. . . . This is a really disturbing story. I feel so sad for Enitan, I cannot possibly imagine what he went through in his childhood. His transformation is remarkable. In the final ending it reveals who Enitan is, and I'm shocked by the revelation. It brings the film to another level of emotional climax.",positive
"Incredible movie, great rendention and good story line.",positive
"Romper Stomper with a twist and also a masterpiece drama. . . . Best Skinhead Cultural movie done in years...if you like movies like Romper Stomper, This is England, A Clockwork Orange...you will probably like this and if you like well made dramas also.... actors first movie produce and from peronal experience too....exellent work mate....loved it...so sad that people down grade this masterpiece in art form from a personal view, from a rookie of making movies... enjoy folks....",positive
"Really great for women (and men too). . In a world where women are pressured to look better than they are, and live above their means, this show serves as a great tool of financial education to guide them into sensible organisation of their finances and the benefits of delayed gratification. Oh, and it's entertaining too! Fantastic acting!. . . . I don't know what's with the music production though, seems like the same songs were on repeat in every episode.",positive
"The use of proverbs, innuendos, and play on words, provides so many memorable one liners and quotes that will remain on our tongues for a long time. We will quote the lines and recall the pleasure of watching this series.",positive

"A very good movie with a good lesson!. . . . This is movie is about a coming of age comedy/drama about a young boy who wants to fix things with his hands rather sit behind a cubicle.

My favorite Nigerian actress Adesua Etomi-wellington brought me to this tv series and I was not disappointed, it was a pleasant surprise to see good acting, really good writing on top of seeing her, all main characters had substance and were not over the top clich√© characters, each episode could stand on it's own with plot twists and reveals, if anybody is looking for a good binge watch you couldn't go wrong with this Nigerian gem",positive
"It‚Äôs a pity, because this could have been very interesting. But as it is, it's just total amateur hour.",positive
Was glued!!!!. . . . I enjoyed it. It was brilliant coming from the stables of Hollywood movies. Not a wasted time spent,positive

Hands down the best Nigerian movie I have ever seen..,positive
Good but Kinda Cheesy. . I liked this murder mystery from Nigeria. . . The plot was thick and readable part way in but far enough in to keep my interest.,positive

Only one problem,positive
"Lionheart is a solid film that effectively portrays sexism in workplace in Nigeria. It is very straightforward, highly predictable and also quite weakly directed by Genevieve Nnaji. But on the opposite side of things, her acting performance is terrific, and she successfully elevated both the character and the overall material. The movie is clich√©d, but charming. It would have been a perfect potential nominee for the Academy had they not stupidly eliminated it due to it being filmed in the English language.",positive
Mind blowing!!!!. . . . This is one of the best movies I have ever watched! I LOVE it!!!!!,positive
"A wonderful film experience! Substantial storyline.. . The suspense would keep you on your toes, and the comic relief would make you chuckle. It is definitely worthwhile.",positive
A good sequel but a remake would have been far better for good story buildup. . . . I must say I commend the director and his acting too ( Ramsey Nouah).,positive
100% on point. So accurate n so well played. Everyone was fantastic. Makes one proud ure Nigerian üëèüëçüòò,positive
"It is beautiful to see Sam Dede on our screens again, and to see he is still a master of his craft, giving us a stellar performance. Where there is Stella Damasus, you can be sure to see some genuine tears, with emotional scenes, and she seems ageless.",positive
Perfection. . . . This is a must watch movie!. I can't even say more. I'm short of words.,positive
Interesting how open the characters are to speaking about their relationships and with restraining anger during such emotional circumstances.,positive
It was pretty interesting to actually find out how the hymn Amazing Grace was actually written.,positive

A terrible way to start the year; 'Akpe' is a mess.,negative
You might not hate yourself for seeing 'SuperStar' but you will leave feeling numb & comatose.,negative
It would definitely be unfair to the entire cast and crew if I left this one out. Totally unfair!,negative

Suitable for 14 year olds. . Performed like a very clean Disney story. Limp and vacuous.,negative

Average. . The plot is just too short and predictable.,negative

"Utter rubbish! These are not serious people. Please, don't reward them with your Naira.",negative
this movie has to be the most depressing romantic comedy we have ever seen.,negative

". Knock Out Blessing' is an utterly useless movie that ought not to have been made, or at least not released to the public. Rubbish!",negative
"Unnecessarily long. . For me,",negative

"My first Nigerian movie. . . . For the past several years, I have come across a number of reports telling about how the country of Nigeria has a successful domestic film industry. While that fact definitely intrigued me, I was unable to find any Nigerian movies available for me to look at until I stumbled upon this one on Netflix. To be honest, I was expecting something pretty crudely made, and to a large degree this is true. While there are some pretty good composed shots and/or direction that indicate that at times some real effort was being made by the filmmakers, the movie has far more shortcomings. The cinematography is unimpressive, there's very little in the way of production values, and the acting by many of the performers is amateurish. Actually, I might have been able to forgive all that had the movie's biggest problem did not exist, that being that it's far too long (121 minutes in length) and far too slowly paced. This is a story that really needed to be cut down either at the script stage or when the footage was being edited. There is a twist towards the end that's a little interesting (despite my ability to somewhat predict it before it unfolded), but it's too little and too late to make it worth sitting through a story that's too long and too slow. Still, if you have heard of Nigerian cinema and are curious about experiencing a sample of it, I've just told you of one possible accessible choice.",negative
"Unfortunately, we can't bear cowboy pistols, space guns, cut & sow costumes, annoyingly talentless filming and unnecessary long form remembrance ceremonies for already shown footage all buttered up with ridiculously unintelligent revelations of supposed-to-be shockers that were apparent from the beginning.",negative

"They just sewed together different jokes, memes and videos of little known comics that have gone viral on Nigerian social media, called it their own movie and brought it to cinema. If you are Big on social media, you will have seen many of them, many times before.

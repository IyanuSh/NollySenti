Accident scene dey always dey tricky give Nollywood to portray,  but na pleasant surprise to see one wey dey believe here.	positive
Citation di film. . Perfect film. I like every second of di film. I wish say make e no end.	positive
Akinnuoye-Agbaje director debut na trouble come- of- age tori base upon di director own experience as 'Farm out' Naija pikin for UK during period of surge xenophobia for di wake of di Windrush generation dem arrival. Di look and feel of di film early moment present settling wit character dem so raw and realistic dat wey pesin fit only capture if dem experience dem. Di pace of di film for many way reflect dis. At time seem to take on almost frantic pace wey dey meaningful for way wey capture di effect of somebody wey dey recall dem life story- make up of di important detail wit traumatic moment- through occasional make am difficult to capture and appreciate di passage of di time border on surreal. Di supporting character dem similar dey raw and dem be identify foil, though lack in depth require to be whole character pass dia interact wit di film lead.  Furthermore, di film just do small to address or context im setting, delibrate choose to focus on di internal struggle of im central character. Despite say di film center character dey compel enough to keep viewer dem engage solely for im development throughout di film. Overall farming na impress director debut wey tackle issue of dual identity wit self hatred for manner wey leave plenty without say but im provide  bitter wit frequent heartbreak account of one individual struggle for meaning wit identity. So much dey to admire for dis film wey present often overlook period for British history,  di important of dat Kain personal topic wey deserve more runtime pass mere 107 minute.	positive

Many mediocre actin dey here and there and something make little to no sense for me but overall I enjoy am for wetin im be. I no go watch am again but as I see am once dey nice.	positive
While di theme here dey nice, redolent of neorealism, di filmmaker no make ostentatious nod give cinema past. Dem voice na their own; di camera dey mobile when im need to be, but e stand still much of di time, letting di excellent cast build their character dem as di event of di film test how Dem fit endure.	positive
Funny Funny Funny. . . . Oh mehn, dis film dey super funny. If you dey find film wey lift your mood up then dis na di right film for you.	positive
